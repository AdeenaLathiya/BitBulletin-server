      "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk took aim at Twitter Inc\u00a0with a $43 billion cash takeover offer on Thursday, with the Tesla CEO saying the social media company needs to be taken private to grow and become a platform for free speech.",
      "\"I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,\" Musk, already San Francisco-based Twitter's second-largest shareholder, said at a TED Talk in Vancouver when asked about his bid.",
      "Musk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter - the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders - and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday. His offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public.",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a $273.6 billion fortune according to a Forbes tally, rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board on Saturday after disclosing his stake, a move analysts said signaled his takeover intentions as a board seat would have limited his shareholding to just under 15%.\u00a0",
      "After his TED talk, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter's board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: \"It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.\"",
      "Twitter was evaluating the offer with guidance from Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, according to a source. The company was also preparing a poison pill as a protective measure against Musk raising his stake as early as Friday, the source said.",
      "Shares of Twitter closed down 1.7% on Thursday.",
      "Investors were not convinced.",
      "Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal tweeted from his verified account about the deal. Describing himself as one of the \"largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter,\" he said Musk's offer undervalued the company and he rejected it.",
      "Musk, for his part, told Twitter it was his \"best and final offer\" and said he would reconsider his investment if the board rejects it.\u00a0",
      "\"This is not a way to sort of make money,\" Musk said during the TED Talk.",
      "\"My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive, is extremely important to the future of civilization,\" Musk added.",
      "Musk makes bid for Twitter",
      "Musk, a self-described \"free speech absolutist,\" has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a poll on Twitter asking users if they believed it adheres to the principle of free speech. More than 70% of the 2 million votes cast said \"No\".",
      "After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following last year's US\u00a0Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: \"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.\"",
      "In remarks on Wednesday - before Musk's announcement - Trump said he \"probably wouldn't have any interest\" in returning to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers.\u00a0",

Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal reassured them that the company was not being \"held hostage\" by news of Musk's offer to buy the company, according to a source.",
      "Musk said US\u00a0investment bank Morgan Stanley was acting as financial adviser for his offer. He did not say how he would finance the transaction if it goes ahead, but told the TED talk audience he \"had sufficient assets,\" without saying more.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Musk could finance the deal with debt and selling Tesla shares.",
      "Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla\u00a0shares, about 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker, last year to settle a tax obligation.",
      "'SERIAL UNDERPERFORMER'",
      "Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters.",
      "Founded just two years after Facebook, Twitter is dwarfed by the social network. Meta, which owns Facebook, generated $118 billion in revenue in 2021 from 1.93 billion daily users. Twitter earned $5.08 billion in revenue last year from 217 million daily users.",
      "\"The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.",
      "Twitter's stock market value has lagged rivals",
      "Twitter will not decide on the fate of Musk's bid on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. What the board is discussing is the parameters of the valuation process and it would then ask its advisers to review the bid and await for the results, the source said.",
      "Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the US\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commision requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some of his Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla private.",
      "\"If he really wants to take Twitter private his past run-ins with regulators might not pose an obstacle \u2013 but it might make potential financing sources leery of providing the cash for the deal \u2013 unless he is willing to pledge a large portion of his Tesla holdings to collateralize the debt,\" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the SEC.",
      "Musk's move also raises the question of whether other bidders might emerge for Twitter.",
      "\"It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.",
      "Musk admitted at the conference that success was not assured but his intent was to retain as many shareholders as allowed by law in a private company.",
      "Asked if there was a \"Plan B\" if Twitter rejected the offer, Musk told the TED conference audience without elaborating: \"There is.\""

        "With the deadline set by the Supreme Court to hold voting on no-trust move fast approaching after a marathon NA session last Saturday, the apex court and the Islamabad High Court  (IHC) had opened their doors beyond their notified timings. The vote was eventually held and saw Khan voted out from the top office.",

        " that \"as a constitutional court, it ensures that cases relating to extreme urgency are presented at any time after the notified timings.\" ",
        "The high court's decision to resume court activity at the unusual hour came after a pre-emptive petition was filed asking the court to restrain Khan from de-notifying Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as chief of the army staff. The then government had denied having any such plans.",
        "Khan today, in what was his first public address since ",
        ", directly addressed the judiciary, and asked: \"My dear judges, my judiciary, I have spent time in jail because of your freedom because I dream that one day the judiciary would stand with the weak people of the society, and not the powerful. ",
        "\"I ask the judiciary that when you opened the court in the dead of night ... this nation has known me for 45 years. Have I ever broken the law? When I played cricket, did anyone every accuse me of match fixing? ",
        "\"During my 25 years of politics, I have never provoked the public against state institutions or the judiciary because my life and death is in Pakistan. I ask you, what crime had I exactly committed that you opened up the courts at midnight?\"",
        "Khan addressed his successor and newly appointed prime minister Shehbaz Sharif and told him to stop the harassment of PTI supporters. \"This crackdown that you're doing against our youth over social media ... listen to this clearly ... the day we give the call, you would not find a place to hide.\"",
        "The former prime minister asked security institutions if the country's nuclear assets would be safe under the leadership of the Sharifs-led government.",
        "Earlier, in his opening remarks, Khan said: \"Whenever a prime minister of Pakistan was removed, people used to distribute sweets. But I am thankful to God that I was removed and you all came and gave me such respect.",
        "\"Pakistan has now become a nation. Whoever thought that an imported government of the US would be accepted by this nation ... on Sunday, the entire nation gave their answer that the imported government stands rejected.",
        "Khan said that the \"decisive moment\" has arrived and the nation needs to choose if it wants slavery or liberty. \"Do we want to be the slaves of the US' slaves or do we want real freedom?\"",
        "He said that the 'imported government' currently in charge was full of individuals out on bail. \"Shehbaz Sharif is out on bail, his son is out on bail, Nawaz Sharif is a convict, and his son is an absconder in London and the same is the case with his sons, daughter and son-in-law.\" ",
        "Khan said that the Americans have \"disrespected\" Pakistan by \"imposing outlaws\" on this nation. \"I will go to every city of the country ... and I challenge to them that they would have never seen the kind of mobility of the public the way I would do.\"",
        "The PTI chairman accused newly appointed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of being involved in corruption to the tune of Rs40billion.",
        "\"Everyone should know that this is not the Pakistan of the 1970s when the US conspired to remove Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ... this is not the same Pakistan. The Pakistan of today is of social media. The country has 60 million mobile phones. All our youth now have a voice and no one can zip their mouths.\"",
        "He told his audience of supporters that he would be in Karachi on Saturday and urged them to take the streets in the entire country.",
        "\"My youth, get ready, I will be out on the streets with you in every city until we do not force them to hold elections,\" he said. ",
        "\"Today marks the beginning of the struggle to find actual freedom,\" he added.",
        "Footage shared by the PTI showed a throng of people at the rally's site. ",
        "Prior to Khan taking the stage, his fellow party leaders, including Ali Amin Gandapur, KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, former defence minister Parvez Khattak, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri addressed the gathering.",
        "\t\t\t ",

        " of PTI MNAs, except for the dissidents, from the National Assembly is not surprising. It is in character with former prime minister Imran Khan\u2019s maverick style of politics. It appears that he would rather wreck the system than accept the humiliation of being ousted. Even a democratic change is not acceptable to his ego. By quitting the National Assembly, he seeks to dismantle the entire edifice. Even in government, the former prime minister never really descended from his container.",
        "The ",
        " as the new prime minister has given an ironic twist to the country\u2019s chequered politics. It is seen as the restoration of the old order after a three-and-a-half-year experiment with \u2018naya Pakistan\u2019. A major challenge for the new government is to bring political stability to the country and curb the economic slide. The challenge demands tough measures to prevent an economic meltdown.",
        "More importantly, the Sharif government needs to work on easing the prevailing polarisation in the country. The transfer of power may have ended the uncertainty that has gripped the country for the past several weeks, but the political crisis is far from over. It will be extremely difficult for a coalition made up of disparate political parties, with varying political agendas, to deliver. But an inclusive government could help build bridges.",
        "In his first speech after being elected, the new prime minister set a clear agenda for his administration that may continue till the end of the year before general elections are called. Surely, the economy is on top of the list of priorities. But it is equally important to reset the country\u2019s foreign policy that had lost its sense of direction under Khan.",
        "The former PM\u2019s actions were proof of his contempt for the constitutional process.",
        "It\u2019s a good decision on the part of the new prime minister to urgently call a meeting of parliament\u2019s security committee to probe the ",
        " to accomplish regime change. There may not be any truth to this theory, but it is imperative to clear the false narrative built around a cable from a former ambassador to Washington. The episode has damaged the country\u2019s image internationally, with political implications at home. The issue has been used by the PTI government to subvert the Constitution.",
        "What happened over the past week plunged the country into a constitutional crisis. Khan\u2019s actions were proof of his contempt for the constitutional process. It may have seemed that he \u2018accepted\u2019 the Supreme Court ruling that declared the April 3 ",
        " illegal, but the reality was different. The high drama that unfolded on April 9 in the Assembly, ahead of the no-confidence vote, showed his defiance of the law.",
        "Every effort was made by his party to filibuster the proceedings of the National Assembly, and it was only minutes before the deadline set by the Supreme Court expired that the vote was called. The threat of imminent court action forced the Speaker to back down. It was a disgraceful exit from office by a leader who has never stopped lecturing on Western democratic values and morality.",
        "The false narrative of a \u2018foreign conspiracy\u2019 against the Khan government failed to prevent the unravelling of the former ruling coalition and stop defections from the erstwhile prime minister\u2019s own party. His decision to quit the National Assembly is yet another example of his recklessness.",

He vows to bring down what he calls an \u2018imported regime\u2019. Such populist ultra-nationalist rhetoric has galvanised his supporters, as evident from the large public rallies across the country. But that cannot change the political dynamics. Given the long history of external involvement in Pakistani politics, many among the educated urban middle class tend to believe in the \u2018foreign conspiracy\u2019 narrative. Support for Imran Khan has certainly soared but it cannot be seen as a game changer. Many of his supporters equate the ",
        " with the so-called Arab Spring that brought down some authoritarian dispensations in the Middle East. Nothing could be more delusionary than to draw such a parallel.",
        "A major question is whether Imran Khan can build and sustain a mass movement to force the new government to call early elections. His single-track strategy has neither worked in the past nor can it succeed now, with the country\u2019s changing social dynamics. He seems to have learnt no lesson from his 2014 dharna that failed to disrupt the system, despite some tacit support from a section of the security establishment.",
        "The PTI\u2019s decision to resign from the Assembly will leave the parliamentary field open to his rivals and could further divide the party. Absence from parliament can adversely affect the party\u2019s electoral base, with a few months left for the general elections.",
        "It is debatable if Khan himself has ever believed in the parliamentary process. He seldom attended Assembly sessions. There is no instance in Pakistan where a ruling party acted like an opposition party. For Khan, every other political leader is corrupt and he would rather not sit with them. His biggest failure was his inability to work within the system. His governance capacity was limited as evident by his arbitrary decisions and frequent changes in his team.",
        "His authoritarian mindset, self-righteousness and lack of understanding of statecraft were the main reasons behind his downfall, and not an external conspiracy. He survived in power for as long as he did, despite heading a minority government because of the prop provided by the security establishment. It fell as soon as the crutches were removed.

        " to surrender before an antiterrorism court within three days after the SHC was informed that the final investigation report of the case had been filed before an ATC.",
        "The high court granted three-day protective bail to the MNA and two other suspects enabling them to approach the trial court. The final charge sheet landed in ATC giving a clean chit to the MNA, his brother MPA Jam Awais, and others after a marathon \u201cscrutiny\u201d conducted by the office of the Sindh prosecutor general. ",
        "The PPP lawmaker and two other suspects had obtained interim pre-arrest bail from SHC last month since the forum of trial court was not available at that time as the prosecution and police took more than two months to submit final charge sheet of the case.",
        "When a single-judge bench headed by Justice Omar Sial took up the matter for hearing on Thursday, investigating officer Inspector Siraj Lashari confirmed that the charge sheet of the case had been filed before the administrative judge of ATCs, Karachi.",
        "The bench in its order observed that these bail applications were entertained by SHC directly because when the applicants had approached this court there was no charge sheet or investigation report of Section 173 CrPC in field in any court at the time and hence, the applicants were given legal shelter till such time the charge sheet/challan was filed before the trial court.",
        "\u201cThis has now been done as has been confirmed by the IO, it would therefore be appropriate now if these applications are converted into applications seeking protective bail and all the applicants in the first instance surrender before the learned ATC court,\u201d it added.",
        "The order further noted that in the event these bail before arrest applications were entertained by the SHC it would effectively eliminate one forum for either the applicants or complainant to approach a higher forum if they were aggrieved by the order of trial court.",
        "\u201cMy second reason to so hold is that it is not a preferred route to interfere with the first instance jurisdiction of the learned trial courts who should be given full opportunity to deal with issues independently and autonomously, it concluded.",
        "The counsel for the MNA submitted that his client had not been named as accused in the final investigation report.",
        "Last week, the National Commission for Human Rights had also moved the SHC to become a party/intervener in the case and contended that there was no chance of a fair trial if the case was left at the mercy of state offices since the alleged connivance of state officials with the accused party was apparent by the conduct of the prosecutor general Sindh for subduing the final charge of the case for around two months; the home department acting under the impetus of PG made utmost attempts to influence the investigation and transfer the same as well as extending official protocol to the  MNA.",
        "The 27-year-old victim, Nazim Jokhio, was found tortured to death at PPP MPA Jam Awais farmhouse in Malir on Nov 3 last year and the MPA along with his brother MNA Jam Karim Bijjar and others were booked for allegedly torturing Nazim to death as he had resisted houbara bustard hunting and filmed the lawmakers\u2019 Arab guests while hunting in the deceased\u2019s village.",
        "Police had filed the interim charge sheet in December naming over 20 as accused persons including both PPP lawmakers, but did not assign their role in the commissioning of the alleged offence. ",
        "The final charge sheet was filed before a magistrate in the last week of January in which the detained MPA and four others were named as accused and the MNA and three others were shown as absconding accused in the case. However, on Feb 8, the judicial magistrate had returned the final charge sheet of the case along with other papers of the case to the IO with direction to file the same before the administrative judge of ATCs as he had observed that the accused had no other intention or motivation behind their acts but to create insecurity and fear in the public or group of public by such act.",
        "Therefore, the final charge sheet remained at the office of the PG on the pretext of detailed scrutiny for more than two months and subsequently, both the PPP lawmakers along with their eight servants have not been named as accused persons and only three guards were charge sheeted.    ",
        "Meanwhile, the administrative judge of the antiterrorism courts on Thursday transferred the case to the ATC-XV for its disposal according to the law, our staff reporter Naeem Sahoutara adds. ",
        "A day ago, the investigating officer of the case Inspector Siraj Lashari had filed the final challan with the ATCs administrative judge. ",

        "PUBLIC policies struggle to survive, and reform agendas get stalled in times of political change. At best, uncertainty surrounds them; at worst, they are scrapped by political opponents when they gain power, especially if they are identified with the previous rulers.",
        "Policy implementation also slows down during political turbulence. Policies must struggle to keep or regain momentum under a new administration. They try to cajole, readjust, tweak, change their attire and yet may die for lack of attention and because of the loathing and ire of the new masters. With a change of crew, a policy\u2019s merit takes a back seat, and political expediency takes the steering wheel. ",
        "Public policies, especially social policies, are usually the first to suffer as they are soft targets for short-sighted politics. Security, defence, energy, the economy and trade are relatively hard to mess around with, at least at the beginning, but education, health, the environment, population welfare and rural development are easy targets.",
        "At a time when political change is taking place in Pakistan \u2014 and what a dramatic and dangerous political change it is along with the attendant brinkmanship \u2014 it is pertinent to remind one that good policies that will benefit the people must be retained rather than scrapped just because the PTI government formulated them.",
        " ",
        "Let us elaborate with some varied examples from the health sector and see how political and social turbulence affects the spread of diseases. ",
        "There is ample evidence that in polio eradication programmes in Pakistan and other countries, election year gives rise to polio cases. Shah Meer Baloch ",
        " in 2019: \u201cAfter general elections in 2013, the number of polio cases rose to 306 in 2014 before dropping to 54 in 2015, 20 in 2016, and only eight in 2017. In 2018, another election year, cases again rose to 12. Within the first six months of 2019, 32 cases of polio have been recorded across the country\u2026 .\u201d His sobering conclusion was that polio cases spiked after each political transition.",
        "Good policies formulated by the previous government must be retained by the new set-up.",
        "Let us now look at an important example of a health programme and see how it has evolved and survived through different governments and in different areas of Pakistan. ",
        "The country has witnessed a phenomenal advance in the social health insurance system. At the national level, it was launched by prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2016 as a health scheme for the poor. It was titled \u2018PM\u2019s National Health Programme\u2019. Poor families in Islamabad, Punjab and Balochistan benefited from this financial protection programme in the case of hospital admissions. ",
        "At the launch of the programme, the prime minister said: \u201cI wish those provinces which are not part of the programme [Sindh and KP] also join the scheme. It is not a matter of politics.\u201d But it was very much a matter of politics. KP was run by the PTI at that time and they didn\u2019t accept the federal offer, but nevertheless started their own health insurance programme \u2014 the Sehat Insaf Card.",
        "Fast forward to 2018, when the PTI formed the federal government. Sindh was run by the PPP which refused to be part of the programme. Seeing this tragedy of politics, which was denying health insurance to the population of Sindh, I, and later Dr Faisal Sultan, convinced the prime minister to change the name of the card from the Sehat Insaf Card to the Qaumi Sehat Card, which eventually happened. ",
        "We wanted to do this in order to insulate this important programme from political change, so that it was not identified with a particular political party. The PTI nevertheless used the card for political purposes by universalising it. So what started off as a financial healthcare protection scheme for those who could not pay is now also available to the rich in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad. This will make it difficult to financially sustain the programme or ensure the quality of services. Most importantly, the rich may crowd out the poor.",
        "What happens to the programme now under the coalition government led by the PML-N remains to be seen. I hope they take it back to vulnerable populations and institutionally strengthen the programme, and that with Sindh now a part of the coalition government, the province will also consider introducing it.",
        "Sometimes governments undo reforms out of political enmity. My writing this column was triggered by a recent news item alluding to the proposed reversal of reforms at the Pakistan Medical Council and the Higher Education Commission. Sooner or later, the authorities\u2019 attention might turn to the National Institute of Health and the Medical Teaching Institutions Reform Act and some other institutional reforms, including the creation of various health regulatory authorities. ",
        "It will be a mistake to reverse the reform process just because these were introduced by the PTI government. There should be a proper objective assessment before any changes are made.",
        "I hope that the new government is able to make special efforts to strengthen primary healthcare in the country. This is where the real problem lies and this is where the real solutions rest for ensuring essential healthcare. ",
        "Around 70 per cent of the country\u2019s essential health services can be provided at the primary healthcare level. If primary healthcare is strengthened and its quality ensured, then it would take the burden off tertiary-level hospitals which are splintering under patient pressure at the moment. Besides, it will uplift vital health indicators which are at the moment abysmal. Universal health coverage is not possible without strong primary healthcare.",
        "Another critical area is meaningful engagement with the private health sector for realising primary healthcare-based universal healthcare in the country. Our ministries of health themselves need institutional reform, and a special public service cadre needs to be developed for doctors and other health professionals. Currently, a doctor can retire in Grade 17 since there is no career path. These are some of those areas which the previous government aspired to change but could not make substantial progress on.",

        "\u201cThey (Meiyappan and and Kundra) have brought the game to disrepute. The purity of the game has been affected. Fans feel cheated and doubts abound if the IPL is clean,\u201d Lodha added. ",

        "As the clock struck midnight on Saturday, Pakistan experienced its ",
        ", with PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari proudly proclaiming: \"Welcome back to Purana Pakistan\". ",
        "The words resonated with many, who had been fed up with the Imran Khan-led PTI government and had been hoping for change. Others weren't too happy that the dream of 'Naya Pakistan' had dissipated so quickly, pouring into the streets the next day to voice their anger. ",
        "Amid the time travel between the ",
        " and the ",
        ", here's what we hope to bring forth in the new ",
        " Pakistan and what we wish to leave behind:",
        "The tales of corruption of Purana Pakistan are nothing short of legend. Be it the ",
        " or the ",
        ", fiscal and moral corruption became one of the rallying cries that propelled the PTI to power. ",
        "The mass appeal for a change in the status quo, evident by the outpouring of support for Imran Khan, should serve as a clear warning for political leaders that Pakistanis will no longer put up with the embezzlement of taxpayers' money. No longer is ",
        " good enough. ",
        "Despite his faults, Imran's accountability crusade \u2014 which mind you, caused a ",
        ", among others \u2014 remains one of the main reasons behind his popularity. ",
        "The new government will really have to prove it's serious about fighting corruption if it wants to survive the next general elections, which are just around the corner. ",
        "One of the PML-N's worst contributions to Pakistan's laws was the draconian Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) in 2016, which has since been ",
        " itself. This time, we hope these political parties will understand that any legislation they pass through parliament today can and will be used against them tomorrow. ",
        "Legislation should be forward-thinking, keeping in mind the requirements of the current day and age and should be aimed at making the lives of citizens better, instead of making adding to their woes. ",
        "In ",
        " Pakistan, who you knew mattered more than what you knew. Whether it was appointments in the bureaucracy, the judiciary or other government agencies, nepotism was rife in all departments. ",
        "Not only did this impact the performance of these institutions, it also demoralised employees who had actually been appointed on merit but were forced to work on the whims of the blue-eyed boys, the majority of whom cared little for service-delivery or facilitating the public. ",
        "One of the worst examples of this could be seen in the police apparatus, which was filled with political appointments and was largely at the beck and call of the respective party in power, facilitating VIP movements and hanging back in Vigos belonging to anyone remotely affiliated with government or their relatives. ",
        "Over the last few decades, Pakistan's political landscape has come to be dominated by the two families \u2014 the Sharifs and the Bhutto (now Bhutto-Zardaris). Both parties seem to have become family-run affairs with the party chiefship being passed down from one generation to the next. ",
        "Amid all this, the PTI \u2014 promising a truly democratic party setup \u2014 seemed like a breath of fresh air.  ",
        "For political parties to survive, they need an induction of fresh minds, not just at the lowest rungs but on the decision-making table. Parties can no longer be run as personal fiefdoms, subservient to the whims of a royal family. ",
        "If you've lived in Karachi at any point during the last three decades, you would know know the feeling of dread each time there was a disagreement between the PPP and the MQM \u2014 which, in case you've forgotten, enjoyed considerable sway back then. ",
        "In fact, each political party with a stake in the city had its own militant wing, whether it was the MQM's trigger-happy target killing squad or the Lyari-based Peoples Aman Committee nurtured by the PPP to do its dirty work. ",
        "Ultimately, as the body count rose and the violence overflowed into every corner of the city \u2014 taking on ethnic flavour \u2014 it was ordinary citizens that were invariably caught in the crossfire. ",
        "In Punjab, the PML-N would do well to keep the Gullu Butts at bay. Gone are the days when henchmen could influence voters. With Twitter, TikTok and Facebook watching, any machismo stunts by the \"lions\" of Punjab are sure to put off potential voters. ",
        "Nor must the PML-N use law enforcers to do their dirty work \u2014 the 14 people, including women, ",
        " are still awaiting justice.  ",
        "As Imran Khan keeps reminding everyone, most cases against the Sharif and Zardari clans were registered in each other's tenures. The idea was to keep the opposition so tied up in court proceedings that they would have no time to spare for political activities. ",
        "Take the ARY Gold and Ursus Tractor corruption cases for example, registered against Asif Ali Zardari in the 1990s during Nawaz Sharif's second tenure as prime minister. The court finally ",
        " almost two decades later in 2014, for want of evidence. Another two cases, the ",
        ", met the same fate a year later. ",
        "As we've seen in \"Naya Pakistan\", these tactics don't really go a long way and ultimately, cede space for non-democratic forces to creep in. ",
        "Speaking of non-democratic forces, Pakistan's political parties have a 70-year-old habit of flirting with the deep state \u2014 much to the detriment of institutional harmony and the democratic process. ",
        "Such experiments are bound to fail. Politicians must have learnt by now that the romance lasts only till the honeymoon period and that for democracy to flourish, it is only the will of the citizens of Pakistan that should matter. ",
        "Let each arm of the state perform its role, without getting involved in matters that are beyond its mandate. ",
        "The dance must end now. ",
        "One of the most disturbing facets of PTI's ",
        " Pakistan was the complete lack of tolerance for critique aimed at the ruling party and its leadership. Critics were regularly trolled on social media and in some instances, even made to feel the leaders' wrath through coercive action by law enforcement agencies. ",
        "In fact, the abuse became so insufferable that 165 women journalists were forced to ",
        " to the PTI government, highlighting the \"online attacks instigated by government officials and then amplified by a large number of Twitter accounts\". It served little purpose, and the abuse continued unabated. ",
        "While the PPP and the PML-N were no saints \u2014 the fate of citizen journalist Nazim Jokhio being the most recent example \u2014 they were admittedly better recipients of critique, not just from opposition parties but also the media. ",
        "During the PPP's reign from 2008 till 2013, a slew of pro-women laws were passed, aimed at addressing sexual harassment, besides curbing regressive practices such as depriving women of their inheritance, forcing them into marriage to settle disputes, etc.  ",
        "Ever since, legislation against domestic violence has also been enacted in many parts of the country, most recently in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. What is needed now, however, are the mechanisms such as women protection committees, shelter homes, etc, to ensure the implementation of the said laws.",
        "One may find a thousand faults with him, but Shehbaz Sharif's stint as the Punjab chief minister earned him much praise for good governance. The younger Sharif worked tirelessly to improve infrastructure and service delivery, particularly in urban centres. ",
        "If he can apply the same rigour as prime minister, the country could make some remarkable leaps in infrastructure development in the years to come. ",
        "All through the 1990s and early 2000s, the Bhuttos and Sharifs were at each other's throats, constantly plotting the ouster of each other's governments. Many a times, they did succeed, only to be thrown out again through the revolving door. ",
        "In 2006, however, the only winners in this game of musical chairs were the ones pulling the strings. Thus was born the ",
        " \u2014 a document signed by Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif in 2006 with the stated aim to return Pakistan to its people.",
        "Subsequently, the PPP government that came into power in 2008 was the first to complete its term. The PML-N too limped to the finish in the subsequent tenure. ",
        "While the system of governance this document has offered is in no way been perfect, it provides a good starting point \u2014 that the country's political leadership, despite their differences, can partake in the electoral process through a system whose sole mandate is ",
        ". "

But this does not mean that we should be gleeful about the sudden change in the PTI\u2019s fortunes. More important questions need to be raised and answered.",

        " to oppose Imran Khan\u2019s deposal as prime minister rather than PTI MNAs and MPAs. Yes, many in big cities like Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad hail from relatively affluent segments, but there are many young people of modest means who are also Khan\u2019s supporters.",
        "We shouldn\u2019t be gleeful about PTI\u2019s reversal of fortunes.",
        "In my calculation, this youthful political subject \u2014 and s/he is a political subject, even with all the vitriol \u2014 has its genesis in the Musharraf years, when digital technology began to shape the polity and demographic change proved the dictatorship\u2019s biggest weapon in its ideological vilification campaign against the \u2018corrupt\u2019 and \u2018dynastic\u2019 PML-N and PPP.",
        "This youthful political subject has now added the regime change rhetoric to its arsenal to build upon the relatively superficial idioms of corruption and dynastic politics that it was already deploying. Whether we like it or not, the Musharraf-Imran lineage of youthful political subjects is here to stay. The challenge for those who imagine progressive politics as more than an establishment-centric merry-go-round is whether and how to engage with this subject.",
        "Recall that the end of the Musharraf dictatorship corresponded with unbridled condemnation of the establishment on the streets. But that sentiment could not be deepened because a progressive political alternative was absent. Thus followed the Imran Khan phenomenon.",
        "The anti-establishment trends and sloganeering at PTI protests of recent days may well be a flash in the pan. But are we just resigned to the fact that the PTI\u2019s brand of populism will descend into proto-fascism? I would rather contemplate longer-term strategies of how to engage the youthful political subject.",
        " ",
        "A related and immediate question is that of the economy. As Akbar Zaidi ",
        " on these pages, there are serious challenges awaiting whoever takes the reins of government for the foreseeable future. The incumbent pattern \u2014 which implicates all mainstream parties and not just the PTI \u2014 is to adopt IMF conditionalities and allow big business as well as rich overseas Pakistanis to make and take their money out of the country at will, and then periodically react to growing public discontent by announcing blanket subsidies.",
        "This piecemeal approach will eventually lead to the kind of ",
        " (although that country\u2019s fate has been triggered by the pandemic to a greater extent than Pakistan). Progressive politics in Pakistan will, instead, have to spell out a genuinely transformative economic programme which must include rural industrialisation/public works programmes, land and other asset redistribution, progressive taxation and a peace dividend with our neighbours that allows us to cut our bloated national security apparatus down to size. Only then can we expect genuine relief from the IMF and imperialist power more generally. And only then can we promise long-term well-being to the youthful majority.",
        "After experiencing the PTI\u2019s reactionary populism, it is natural that many of us are heaving a sigh of relief. The PPP, PML-N, JUI-F and others who now occupy the treasury benches will not, however, be able to explain away Pakistan\u2019s long-standing problems as a PTI inheritance. It is worth being reminded that the relative euphoria that accompanied the end of the Musharraf dictatorship and the high point of the 18th Amendment dissipated because underlying demographic, economic and other structural factors were not addressed.",
        "In short, we need a meaningful political and economic programme. We can continue to lament \u2018youthiyas\u2019 or engage in political gossip about whether the establishment is divided and Gen Bajwa\u2019s decision not to seek another extension past November. But this will neither end militarisation of the state, nor halt the politics of hate.",
