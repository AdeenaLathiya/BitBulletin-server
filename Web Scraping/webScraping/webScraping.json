      "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk took aim at Twitter Inc\u00a0with a $43 billion cash takeover offer on Thursday, with the Tesla CEO saying the social media company needs to be taken private to grow and become a platform for free speech.",
      "\"I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,\" Musk, already San Francisco-based Twitter's second-largest shareholder, said at a TED Talk in Vancouver when asked about his bid.",
      "Musk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter - the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders - and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday. His offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public.",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a $273.6 billion fortune according to a Forbes tally, rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board on Saturday after disclosing his stake, a move analysts said signaled his takeover intentions as a board seat would have limited his shareholding to just under 15%.\u00a0",
      "After his TED talk, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter's board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: \"It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.\"",
      "Twitter was evaluating the offer with guidance from Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, according to a source. The company was also preparing a poison pill as a protective measure against Musk raising his stake as early as Friday, the source said.",
      "Shares of Twitter closed down 1.7% on Thursday.",
      "Investors were not convinced.",
      "Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal tweeted from his verified account about the deal. Describing himself as one of the \"largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter,\" he said Musk's offer undervalued the company and he rejected it.",
      "Musk, for his part, told Twitter it was his \"best and final offer\" and said he would reconsider his investment if the board rejects it.\u00a0",
      "\"This is not a way to sort of make money,\" Musk said during the TED Talk.",
      "\"My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive, is extremely important to the future of civilization,\" Musk added.",
      "Musk makes bid for Twitter",
      "Musk, a self-described \"free speech absolutist,\" has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a poll on Twitter asking users if they believed it adheres to the principle of free speech. More than 70% of the 2 million votes cast said \"No\".",
      "After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following last year's US\u00a0Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: \"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.\"",
      "In remarks on Wednesday - before Musk's announcement - Trump said he \"probably wouldn't have any interest\" in returning to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers.\u00a0",

Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal reassured them that the company was not being \"held hostage\" by news of Musk's offer to buy the company, according to a source.",
      "Musk said US\u00a0investment bank Morgan Stanley was acting as financial adviser for his offer. He did not say how he would finance the transaction if it goes ahead, but told the TED talk audience he \"had sufficient assets,\" without saying more.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Musk could finance the deal with debt and selling Tesla shares.",
      "Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla\u00a0shares, about 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker, last year to settle a tax obligation.",
      "'SERIAL UNDERPERFORMER'",
      "Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters.",
      "Founded just two years after Facebook, Twitter is dwarfed by the social network. Meta, which owns Facebook, generated $118 billion in revenue in 2021 from 1.93 billion daily users. Twitter earned $5.08 billion in revenue last year from 217 million daily users.",
      "\"The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.",
      "Twitter's stock market value has lagged rivals",
      "Twitter will not decide on the fate of Musk's bid on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. What the board is discussing is the parameters of the valuation process and it would then ask its advisers to review the bid and await for the results, the source said.",
      "Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the US\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commision requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some of his Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla private.",
      "\"If he really wants to take Twitter private his past run-ins with regulators might not pose an obstacle \u2013 but it might make potential financing sources leery of providing the cash for the deal \u2013 unless he is willing to pledge a large portion of his Tesla holdings to collateralize the debt,\" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the SEC.",
      "Musk's move also raises the question of whether other bidders might emerge for Twitter.",
      "\"It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.",
      "Musk admitted at the conference that success was not assured but his intent was to retain as many shareholders as allowed by law in a private company.",
      "Asked if there was a \"Plan B\" if Twitter rejected the offer, Musk told the TED conference audience without elaborating: \"There is.\""

        "With the deadline set by the Supreme Court to hold voting on no-trust move fast approaching after a marathon NA session last Saturday, the apex court and the Islamabad High Court  (IHC) had opened their doors beyond their notified timings. The vote was eventually held and saw Khan voted out from the top office.",

        " that \"as a constitutional court, it ensures that cases relating to extreme urgency are presented at any time after the notified timings.\" ",
        "The high court's decision to resume court activity at the unusual hour came after a pre-emptive petition was filed asking the court to restrain Khan from de-notifying Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as chief of the army staff. The then government had denied having any such plans.",
        "Khan today, in what was his first public address since ",
        ", directly addressed the judiciary, and asked: \"My dear judges, my judiciary, I have spent time in jail because of your freedom because I dream that one day the judiciary would stand with the weak people of the society, and not the powerful. ",
        "\"I ask the judiciary that when you opened the court in the dead of night ... this nation has known me for 45 years. Have I ever broken the law? When I played cricket, did anyone every accuse me of match fixing? ",
        "\"During my 25 years of politics, I have never provoked the public against state institutions or the judiciary because my life and death is in Pakistan. I ask you, what crime had I exactly committed that you opened up the courts at midnight?\"",
        "Khan addressed his successor and newly appointed prime minister Shehbaz Sharif and told him to stop the harassment of PTI supporters. \"This crackdown that you're doing against our youth over social media ... listen to this clearly ... the day we give the call, you would not find a place to hide.\"",
        "The former prime minister asked security institutions if the country's nuclear assets would be safe under the leadership of the Sharifs-led government.",
        "Earlier, in his opening remarks, Khan said: \"Whenever a prime minister of Pakistan was removed, people used to distribute sweets. But I am thankful to God that I was removed and you all came and gave me such respect.",
        "\"Pakistan has now become a nation. Whoever thought that an imported government of the US would be accepted by this nation ... on Sunday, the entire nation gave their answer that the imported government stands rejected.",
        "Khan said that the \"decisive moment\" has arrived and the nation needs to choose if it wants slavery or liberty. \"Do we want to be the slaves of the US' slaves or do we want real freedom?\"",
        "He said that the 'imported government' currently in charge was full of individuals out on bail. \"Shehbaz Sharif is out on bail, his son is out on bail, Nawaz Sharif is a convict, and his son is an absconder in London and the same is the case with his sons, daughter and son-in-law.\" ",
        "Khan said that the Americans have \"disrespected\" Pakistan by \"imposing outlaws\" on this nation. \"I will go to every city of the country ... and I challenge to them that they would have never seen the kind of mobility of the public the way I would do.\"",
        "The PTI chairman accused newly appointed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of being involved in corruption to the tune of Rs40billion.",
        "\"Everyone should know that this is not the Pakistan of the 1970s when the US conspired to remove Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ... this is not the same Pakistan. The Pakistan of today is of social media. The country has 60 million mobile phones. All our youth now have a voice and no one can zip their mouths.\"",
        "He told his audience of supporters that he would be in Karachi on Saturday and urged them to take the streets in the entire country.",
        "\"My youth, get ready, I will be out on the streets with you in every city until we do not force them to hold elections,\" he said. ",
        "\"Today marks the beginning of the struggle to find actual freedom,\" he added.",
        "Footage shared by the PTI showed a throng of people at the rally's site. ",
        "Prior to Khan taking the stage, his fellow party leaders, including Ali Amin Gandapur, KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, former defence minister Parvez Khattak, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri addressed the gathering.",
        "\t\t\t ",

        " of PTI MNAs, except for the dissidents, from the National Assembly is not surprising. It is in character with former prime minister Imran Khan\u2019s maverick style of politics. It appears that he would rather wreck the system than accept the humiliation of being ousted. Even a democratic change is not acceptable to his ego. By quitting the National Assembly, he seeks to dismantle the entire edifice. Even in government, the former prime minister never really descended from his container.",
        "The ",
        " as the new prime minister has given an ironic twist to the country\u2019s chequered politics. It is seen as the restoration of the old order after a three-and-a-half-year experiment with \u2018naya Pakistan\u2019. A major challenge for the new government is to bring political stability to the country and curb the economic slide. The challenge demands tough measures to prevent an economic meltdown.",
        "More importantly, the Sharif government needs to work on easing the prevailing polarisation in the country. The transfer of power may have ended the uncertainty that has gripped the country for the past several weeks, but the political crisis is far from over. It will be extremely difficult for a coalition made up of disparate political parties, with varying political agendas, to deliver. But an inclusive government could help build bridges.",
        "In his first speech after being elected, the new prime minister set a clear agenda for his administration that may continue till the end of the year before general elections are called. Surely, the economy is on top of the list of priorities. But it is equally important to reset the country\u2019s foreign policy that had lost its sense of direction under Khan.",
        "The former PM\u2019s actions were proof of his contempt for the constitutional process.",
        "It\u2019s a good decision on the part of the new prime minister to urgently call a meeting of parliament\u2019s security committee to probe the ",
        " to accomplish regime change. There may not be any truth to this theory, but it is imperative to clear the false narrative built around a cable from a former ambassador to Washington. The episode has damaged the country\u2019s image internationally, with political implications at home. The issue has been used by the PTI government to subvert the Constitution.",
        "What happened over the past week plunged the country into a constitutional crisis. Khan\u2019s actions were proof of his contempt for the constitutional process. It may have seemed that he \u2018accepted\u2019 the Supreme Court ruling that declared the April 3 ",
        " illegal, but the reality was different. The high drama that unfolded on April 9 in the Assembly, ahead of the no-confidence vote, showed his defiance of the law.",
        "Every effort was made by his party to filibuster the proceedings of the National Assembly, and it was only minutes before the deadline set by the Supreme Court expired that the vote was called. The threat of imminent court action forced the Speaker to back down. It was a disgraceful exit from office by a leader who has never stopped lecturing on Western democratic values and morality.",
        "The false narrative of a \u2018foreign conspiracy\u2019 against the Khan government failed to prevent the unravelling of the former ruling coalition and stop defections from the erstwhile prime minister\u2019s own party. His decision to quit the National Assembly is yet another example of his recklessness.",

He vows to bring down what he calls an \u2018imported regime\u2019. Such populist ultra-nationalist rhetoric has galvanised his supporters, as evident from the large public rallies across the country. But that cannot change the political dynamics. Given the long history of external involvement in Pakistani politics, many among the educated urban middle class tend to believe in the \u2018foreign conspiracy\u2019 narrative. Support for Imran Khan has certainly soared but it cannot be seen as a game changer. Many of his supporters equate the ",
        " with the so-called Arab Spring that brought down some authoritarian dispensations in the Middle East. Nothing could be more delusionary than to draw such a parallel.",
        "A major question is whether Imran Khan can build and sustain a mass movement to force the new government to call early elections. His single-track strategy has neither worked in the past nor can it succeed now, with the country\u2019s changing social dynamics. He seems to have learnt no lesson from his 2014 dharna that failed to disrupt the system, despite some tacit support from a section of the security establishment.",
        "The PTI\u2019s decision to resign from the Assembly will leave the parliamentary field open to his rivals and could further divide the party. Absence from parliament can adversely affect the party\u2019s electoral base, with a few months left for the general elections.",
        "It is debatable if Khan himself has ever believed in the parliamentary process. He seldom attended Assembly sessions. There is no instance in Pakistan where a ruling party acted like an opposition party. For Khan, every other political leader is corrupt and he would rather not sit with them. His biggest failure was his inability to work within the system. His governance capacity was limited as evident by his arbitrary decisions and frequent changes in his team.",
        "His authoritarian mindset, self-righteousness and lack of understanding of statecraft were the main reasons behind his downfall, and not an external conspiracy. He survived in power for as long as he did, despite heading a minority government because of the prop provided by the security establishment. It fell as soon as the crutches were removed.

        " to surrender before an antiterrorism court within three days after the SHC was informed that the final investigation report of the case had been filed before an ATC.",
        "The high court granted three-day protective bail to the MNA and two other suspects enabling them to approach the trial court. The final charge sheet landed in ATC giving a clean chit to the MNA, his brother MPA Jam Awais, and others after a marathon \u201cscrutiny\u201d conducted by the office of the Sindh prosecutor general. ",
        "The PPP lawmaker and two other suspects had obtained interim pre-arrest bail from SHC last month since the forum of trial court was not available at that time as the prosecution and police took more than two months to submit final charge sheet of the case.",
        "When a single-judge bench headed by Justice Omar Sial took up the matter for hearing on Thursday, investigating officer Inspector Siraj Lashari confirmed that the charge sheet of the case had been filed before the administrative judge of ATCs, Karachi.",
        "The bench in its order observed that these bail applications were entertained by SHC directly because when the applicants had approached this court there was no charge sheet or investigation report of Section 173 CrPC in field in any court at the time and hence, the applicants were given legal shelter till such time the charge sheet/challan was filed before the trial court.",
        "\u201cThis has now been done as has been confirmed by the IO, it would therefore be appropriate now if these applications are converted into applications seeking protective bail and all the applicants in the first instance surrender before the learned ATC court,\u201d it added.",
        "The order further noted that in the event these bail before arrest applications were entertained by the SHC it would effectively eliminate one forum for either the applicants or complainant to approach a higher forum if they were aggrieved by the order of trial court.",
        "\u201cMy second reason to so hold is that it is not a preferred route to interfere with the first instance jurisdiction of the learned trial courts who should be given full opportunity to deal with issues independently and autonomously, it concluded.",
        "The counsel for the MNA submitted that his client had not been named as accused in the final investigation report.",
        "Last week, the National Commission for Human Rights had also moved the SHC to become a party/intervener in the case and contended that there was no chance of a fair trial if the case was left at the mercy of state offices since the alleged connivance of state officials with the accused party was apparent by the conduct of the prosecutor general Sindh for subduing the final charge of the case for around two months; the home department acting under the impetus of PG made utmost attempts to influence the investigation and transfer the same as well as extending official protocol to the  MNA.",
        "The 27-year-old victim, Nazim Jokhio, was found tortured to death at PPP MPA Jam Awais farmhouse in Malir on Nov 3 last year and the MPA along with his brother MNA Jam Karim Bijjar and others were booked for allegedly torturing Nazim to death as he had resisted houbara bustard hunting and filmed the lawmakers\u2019 Arab guests while hunting in the deceased\u2019s village.",
        "Police had filed the interim charge sheet in December naming over 20 as accused persons including both PPP lawmakers, but did not assign their role in the commissioning of the alleged offence. ",
        "The final charge sheet was filed before a magistrate in the last week of January in which the detained MPA and four others were named as accused and the MNA and three others were shown as absconding accused in the case. However, on Feb 8, the judicial magistrate had returned the final charge sheet of the case along with other papers of the case to the IO with direction to file the same before the administrative judge of ATCs as he had observed that the accused had no other intention or motivation behind their acts but to create insecurity and fear in the public or group of public by such act.",
        "Therefore, the final charge sheet remained at the office of the PG on the pretext of detailed scrutiny for more than two months and subsequently, both the PPP lawmakers along with their eight servants have not been named as accused persons and only three guards were charge sheeted.    ",
        "Meanwhile, the administrative judge of the antiterrorism courts on Thursday transferred the case to the ATC-XV for its disposal according to the law, our staff reporter Naeem Sahoutara adds. ",
        "A day ago, the investigating officer of the case Inspector Siraj Lashari had filed the final challan with the ATCs administrative judge. ",

        "PUBLIC policies struggle to survive, and reform agendas get stalled in times of political change. At best, uncertainty surrounds them; at worst, they are scrapped by political opponents when they gain power, especially if they are identified with the previous rulers.",
        "Policy implementation also slows down during political turbulence. Policies must struggle to keep or regain momentum under a new administration. They try to cajole, readjust, tweak, change their attire and yet may die for lack of attention and because of the loathing and ire of the new masters. With a change of crew, a policy\u2019s merit takes a back seat, and political expediency takes the steering wheel. ",
        "Public policies, especially social policies, are usually the first to suffer as they are soft targets for short-sighted politics. Security, defence, energy, the economy and trade are relatively hard to mess around with, at least at the beginning, but education, health, the environment, population welfare and rural development are easy targets.",
        "At a time when political change is taking place in Pakistan \u2014 and what a dramatic and dangerous political change it is along with the attendant brinkmanship \u2014 it is pertinent to remind one that good policies that will benefit the people must be retained rather than scrapped just because the PTI government formulated them.",
        " ",
        "Let us elaborate with some varied examples from the health sector and see how political and social turbulence affects the spread of diseases. ",
        "There is ample evidence that in polio eradication programmes in Pakistan and other countries, election year gives rise to polio cases. Shah Meer Baloch ",
        " in 2019: \u201cAfter general elections in 2013, the number of polio cases rose to 306 in 2014 before dropping to 54 in 2015, 20 in 2016, and only eight in 2017. In 2018, another election year, cases again rose to 12. Within the first six months of 2019, 32 cases of polio have been recorded across the country\u2026 .\u201d His sobering conclusion was that polio cases spiked after each political transition.",
        "Good policies formulated by the previous government must be retained by the new set-up.",
        "Let us now look at an important example of a health programme and see how it has evolved and survived through different governments and in different areas of Pakistan. ",
        "The country has witnessed a phenomenal advance in the social health insurance system. At the national level, it was launched by prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2016 as a health scheme for the poor. It was titled \u2018PM\u2019s National Health Programme\u2019. Poor families in Islamabad, Punjab and Balochistan benefited from this financial protection programme in the case of hospital admissions. ",
        "At the launch of the programme, the prime minister said: \u201cI wish those provinces which are not part of the programme [Sindh and KP] also join the scheme. It is not a matter of politics.\u201d But it was very much a matter of politics. KP was run by the PTI at that time and they didn\u2019t accept the federal offer, but nevertheless started their own health insurance programme \u2014 the Sehat Insaf Card.",
        "Fast forward to 2018, when the PTI formed the federal government. Sindh was run by the PPP which refused to be part of the programme. Seeing this tragedy of politics, which was denying health insurance to the population of Sindh, I, and later Dr Faisal Sultan, convinced the prime minister to change the name of the card from the Sehat Insaf Card to the Qaumi Sehat Card, which eventually happened. ",
        "We wanted to do this in order to insulate this important programme from political change, so that it was not identified with a particular political party. The PTI nevertheless used the card for political purposes by universalising it. So what started off as a financial healthcare protection scheme for those who could not pay is now also available to the rich in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad. This will make it difficult to financially sustain the programme or ensure the quality of services. Most importantly, the rich may crowd out the poor.",
        "What happens to the programme now under the coalition government led by the PML-N remains to be seen. I hope they take it back to vulnerable populations and institutionally strengthen the programme, and that with Sindh now a part of the coalition government, the province will also consider introducing it.",
        "Sometimes governments undo reforms out of political enmity. My writing this column was triggered by a recent news item alluding to the proposed reversal of reforms at the Pakistan Medical Council and the Higher Education Commission. Sooner or later, the authorities\u2019 attention might turn to the National Institute of Health and the Medical Teaching Institutions Reform Act and some other institutional reforms, including the creation of various health regulatory authorities. ",
        "It will be a mistake to reverse the reform process just because these were introduced by the PTI government. There should be a proper objective assessment before any changes are made.",
        "I hope that the new government is able to make special efforts to strengthen primary healthcare in the country. This is where the real problem lies and this is where the real solutions rest for ensuring essential healthcare. ",
        "Around 70 per cent of the country\u2019s essential health services can be provided at the primary healthcare level. If primary healthcare is strengthened and its quality ensured, then it would take the burden off tertiary-level hospitals which are splintering under patient pressure at the moment. Besides, it will uplift vital health indicators which are at the moment abysmal. Universal health coverage is not possible without strong primary healthcare.",
        "Another critical area is meaningful engagement with the private health sector for realising primary healthcare-based universal healthcare in the country. Our ministries of health themselves need institutional reform, and a special public service cadre needs to be developed for doctors and other health professionals. Currently, a doctor can retire in Grade 17 since there is no career path. These are some of those areas which the previous government aspired to change but could not make substantial progress on.",

        "\u201cThey (Meiyappan and and Kundra) have brought the game to disrepute. The purity of the game has been affected. Fans feel cheated and doubts abound if the IPL is clean,\u201d Lodha added. ",

        "As the clock struck midnight on Saturday, Pakistan experienced its ",
        ", with PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari proudly proclaiming: \"Welcome back to Purana Pakistan\". ",
        "The words resonated with many, who had been fed up with the Imran Khan-led PTI government and had been hoping for change. Others weren't too happy that the dream of 'Naya Pakistan' had dissipated so quickly, pouring into the streets the next day to voice their anger. ",
        "Amid the time travel between the ",
        " and the ",
        ", here's what we hope to bring forth in the new ",
        " Pakistan and what we wish to leave behind:",
        "The tales of corruption of Purana Pakistan are nothing short of legend. Be it the ",
        " or the ",
        ", fiscal and moral corruption became one of the rallying cries that propelled the PTI to power. ",
        "The mass appeal for a change in the status quo, evident by the outpouring of support for Imran Khan, should serve as a clear warning for political leaders that Pakistanis will no longer put up with the embezzlement of taxpayers' money. No longer is ",
        " good enough. ",
        "Despite his faults, Imran's accountability crusade \u2014 which mind you, caused a ",
        ", among others \u2014 remains one of the main reasons behind his popularity. ",
        "The new government will really have to prove it's serious about fighting corruption if it wants to survive the next general elections, which are just around the corner. ",
        "One of the PML-N's worst contributions to Pakistan's laws was the draconian Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) in 2016, which has since been ",
        " itself. This time, we hope these political parties will understand that any legislation they pass through parliament today can and will be used against them tomorrow. ",
        "Legislation should be forward-thinking, keeping in mind the requirements of the current day and age and should be aimed at making the lives of citizens better, instead of making adding to their woes. ",
        "In ",
        " Pakistan, who you knew mattered more than what you knew. Whether it was appointments in the bureaucracy, the judiciary or other government agencies, nepotism was rife in all departments. ",
        "Not only did this impact the performance of these institutions, it also demoralised employees who had actually been appointed on merit but were forced to work on the whims of the blue-eyed boys, the majority of whom cared little for service-delivery or facilitating the public. ",
        "One of the worst examples of this could be seen in the police apparatus, which was filled with political appointments and was largely at the beck and call of the respective party in power, facilitating VIP movements and hanging back in Vigos belonging to anyone remotely affiliated with government or their relatives. ",
        "Over the last few decades, Pakistan's political landscape has come to be dominated by the two families \u2014 the Sharifs and the Bhutto (now Bhutto-Zardaris). Both parties seem to have become family-run affairs with the party chiefship being passed down from one generation to the next. ",
        "Amid all this, the PTI \u2014 promising a truly democratic party setup \u2014 seemed like a breath of fresh air.  ",
        "For political parties to survive, they need an induction of fresh minds, not just at the lowest rungs but on the decision-making table. Parties can no longer be run as personal fiefdoms, subservient to the whims of a royal family. ",
        "If you've lived in Karachi at any point during the last three decades, you would know know the feeling of dread each time there was a disagreement between the PPP and the MQM \u2014 which, in case you've forgotten, enjoyed considerable sway back then. ",
        "In fact, each political party with a stake in the city had its own militant wing, whether it was the MQM's trigger-happy target killing squad or the Lyari-based Peoples Aman Committee nurtured by the PPP to do its dirty work. ",
        "Ultimately, as the body count rose and the violence overflowed into every corner of the city \u2014 taking on ethnic flavour \u2014 it was ordinary citizens that were invariably caught in the crossfire. ",
        "In Punjab, the PML-N would do well to keep the Gullu Butts at bay. Gone are the days when henchmen could influence voters. With Twitter, TikTok and Facebook watching, any machismo stunts by the \"lions\" of Punjab are sure to put off potential voters. ",
        "Nor must the PML-N use law enforcers to do their dirty work \u2014 the 14 people, including women, ",
        " are still awaiting justice.  ",
        "As Imran Khan keeps reminding everyone, most cases against the Sharif and Zardari clans were registered in each other's tenures. The idea was to keep the opposition so tied up in court proceedings that they would have no time to spare for political activities. ",
        "Take the ARY Gold and Ursus Tractor corruption cases for example, registered against Asif Ali Zardari in the 1990s during Nawaz Sharif's second tenure as prime minister. The court finally ",
        " almost two decades later in 2014, for want of evidence. Another two cases, the ",
        ", met the same fate a year later. ",
        "As we've seen in \"Naya Pakistan\", these tactics don't really go a long way and ultimately, cede space for non-democratic forces to creep in. ",
        "Speaking of non-democratic forces, Pakistan's political parties have a 70-year-old habit of flirting with the deep state \u2014 much to the detriment of institutional harmony and the democratic process. ",
        "Such experiments are bound to fail. Politicians must have learnt by now that the romance lasts only till the honeymoon period and that for democracy to flourish, it is only the will of the citizens of Pakistan that should matter. ",
        "Let each arm of the state perform its role, without getting involved in matters that are beyond its mandate. ",
        "The dance must end now. ",
        "One of the most disturbing facets of PTI's ",
        " Pakistan was the complete lack of tolerance for critique aimed at the ruling party and its leadership. Critics were regularly trolled on social media and in some instances, even made to feel the leaders' wrath through coercive action by law enforcement agencies. ",
        "In fact, the abuse became so insufferable that 165 women journalists were forced to ",
        " to the PTI government, highlighting the \"online attacks instigated by government officials and then amplified by a large number of Twitter accounts\". It served little purpose, and the abuse continued unabated. ",
        "While the PPP and the PML-N were no saints \u2014 the fate of citizen journalist Nazim Jokhio being the most recent example \u2014 they were admittedly better recipients of critique, not just from opposition parties but also the media. ",
        "During the PPP's reign from 2008 till 2013, a slew of pro-women laws were passed, aimed at addressing sexual harassment, besides curbing regressive practices such as depriving women of their inheritance, forcing them into marriage to settle disputes, etc.  ",
        "Ever since, legislation against domestic violence has also been enacted in many parts of the country, most recently in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. What is needed now, however, are the mechanisms such as women protection committees, shelter homes, etc, to ensure the implementation of the said laws.",
        "One may find a thousand faults with him, but Shehbaz Sharif's stint as the Punjab chief minister earned him much praise for good governance. The younger Sharif worked tirelessly to improve infrastructure and service delivery, particularly in urban centres. ",
        "If he can apply the same rigour as prime minister, the country could make some remarkable leaps in infrastructure development in the years to come. ",
        "All through the 1990s and early 2000s, the Bhuttos and Sharifs were at each other's throats, constantly plotting the ouster of each other's governments. Many a times, they did succeed, only to be thrown out again through the revolving door. ",
        "In 2006, however, the only winners in this game of musical chairs were the ones pulling the strings. Thus was born the ",
        " \u2014 a document signed by Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif in 2006 with the stated aim to return Pakistan to its people.",
        "Subsequently, the PPP government that came into power in 2008 was the first to complete its term. The PML-N too limped to the finish in the subsequent tenure. ",
        "While the system of governance this document has offered is in no way been perfect, it provides a good starting point \u2014 that the country's political leadership, despite their differences, can partake in the electoral process through a system whose sole mandate is ",
        ". "

But this does not mean that we should be gleeful about the sudden change in the PTI\u2019s fortunes. More important questions need to be raised and answered.",

        " to oppose Imran Khan\u2019s deposal as prime minister rather than PTI MNAs and MPAs. Yes, many in big cities like Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad hail from relatively affluent segments, but there are many young people of modest means who are also Khan\u2019s supporters.",
        "We shouldn\u2019t be gleeful about PTI\u2019s reversal of fortunes.",
        "In my calculation, this youthful political subject \u2014 and s/he is a political subject, even with all the vitriol \u2014 has its genesis in the Musharraf years, when digital technology began to shape the polity and demographic change proved the dictatorship\u2019s biggest weapon in its ideological vilification campaign against the \u2018corrupt\u2019 and \u2018dynastic\u2019 PML-N and PPP.",
        "This youthful political subject has now added the regime change rhetoric to its arsenal to build upon the relatively superficial idioms of corruption and dynastic politics that it was already deploying. Whether we like it or not, the Musharraf-Imran lineage of youthful political subjects is here to stay. The challenge for those who imagine progressive politics as more than an establishment-centric merry-go-round is whether and how to engage with this subject.",
        "Recall that the end of the Musharraf dictatorship corresponded with unbridled condemnation of the establishment on the streets. But that sentiment could not be deepened because a progressive political alternative was absent. Thus followed the Imran Khan phenomenon.",
        "The anti-establishment trends and sloganeering at PTI protests of recent days may well be a flash in the pan. But are we just resigned to the fact that the PTI\u2019s brand of populism will descend into proto-fascism? I would rather contemplate longer-term strategies of how to engage the youthful political subject.",
        " ",
        "A related and immediate question is that of the economy. As Akbar Zaidi ",
        " on these pages, there are serious challenges awaiting whoever takes the reins of government for the foreseeable future. The incumbent pattern \u2014 which implicates all mainstream parties and not just the PTI \u2014 is to adopt IMF conditionalities and allow big business as well as rich overseas Pakistanis to make and take their money out of the country at will, and then periodically react to growing public discontent by announcing blanket subsidies.",
        "This piecemeal approach will eventually lead to the kind of ",
        " (although that country\u2019s fate has been triggered by the pandemic to a greater extent than Pakistan). Progressive politics in Pakistan will, instead, have to spell out a genuinely transformative economic programme which must include rural industrialisation/public works programmes, land and other asset redistribution, progressive taxation and a peace dividend with our neighbours that allows us to cut our bloated national security apparatus down to size. Only then can we expect genuine relief from the IMF and imperialist power more generally. And only then can we promise long-term well-being to the youthful majority.",
        "After experiencing the PTI\u2019s reactionary populism, it is natural that many of us are heaving a sigh of relief. The PPP, PML-N, JUI-F and others who now occupy the treasury benches will not, however, be able to explain away Pakistan\u2019s long-standing problems as a PTI inheritance. It is worth being reminded that the relative euphoria that accompanied the end of the Musharraf dictatorship and the high point of the 18th Amendment dissipated because underlying demographic, economic and other structural factors were not addressed.",
        "In short, we need a meaningful political and economic programme. We can continue to lament \u2018youthiyas\u2019 or engage in political gossip about whether the establishment is divided and Gen Bajwa\u2019s decision not to seek another extension past November. But this will neither end militarisation of the state, nor halt the politics of hate.",

Secretary Finance Hamed Yaqoob Shaikh also had a virtual contact with the new IMF mission chief to Pakistan Nathan Porter on Thursday night.Informed sources said Mr Miftah and Secretary Shaikh are now scheduled to open formal dialogue with IMF mission chief Porter in Washington on Monday (April 18) on how to revive the programme and agree on further steps that could be made part of the upcoming federal budget 2022-23 in June.Informed sources said Mr Miftah informed Ms Ruiz of the decision of the new government to engage with the fund on measures to take the existing programme forward. These sources said the IMF side \u2014 both in Islamabad and Washington \u2014 welcomed the initiative and promised to work out measures for financial and economic stability and move towards building buffers.The fund officials suggested the authorities to prepare their side of the homework including corrective measures that could stop the bleeding that particularly started after the last-month relief-cum-amnesty package with financial implications of more than Rs300bn. These would then be taken up on Monday for discussions. Ms Ruiz could not be reached for comments.The sources said Mr Miftah also had another meeting with World Bank\u2019s country director in Islamabad Najy Benhassine on Thursday night and discussed its lending pipeline including concessionary financing under the International Development Assistance (IDA) for the next financial year as well.Mr Miftah had last week blamed the PTI government for creating an unprecedented economic mess, particularly leaving behind domestic and external financial accounts in a precarious position.

{"title": ["Reko Diq \u2014 dealing against a tight deadline"], "author": ["Afshan Subohi"], "content": ["AVOIDING the mistakes made earlier, the government will hopefully set its priorities right in the context of the Reko Diq project. Before sealing the deal with Barrick Gold, the world second biggest precious metals company, it seems prudent to first have on board the most credible guarantors, the people of Balochistan, through their representatives in national and provincial assemblies and their designated group of technical and legal experts.Responding to a  query in this regard, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said: \u201cThe draft of the framework agreement was shared with all the relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the deal with Barrick Gold will only be sealed after clearance from the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the national and Balochistan assemblies.\u201dDefending the decision, which some experts found hasty, he said: \u201cWe had to sign the framework because Tethyan Copper Company [a joint venture company of Barrick Gold and Antofagasta Minerals] had given us reprieve from courts till March 31.\u201dRecently, Pakistan reached an out-of-court settlement with two foreign mineral companies to write off their financial claims against the government in exchange for reconstitution of the project for the development of Reko Diq mines on the basis of an equal partnership. The government claimed it was able to dodge a hefty $11 billion penalty through this . The out-of-court settlement is good news for the country, but the govt\u2019s hand might have been a bit forced by the March 31 time barThe federal and Balochistan governments and two companies, Antofagasta PLC and Barrick Gold Corporation, earlier this month agreed on a framework to revive Reko Diq project and a pathway for the exit of one firm. Antofagasta consented to withdraw all claims and move away if Pakistan initiates the payment process of $900 million before the turn of the current month against the court award of $3.7bn. An informed source in Islamabad active in mining circles told  that Pakistan has pledged to divert the signing bonus of $900m with Barrick Gold for the mining deal to Antofagasta to ease it out.This piece of information was indirectly confirmed by the finance minister while answering the query on the motivation, haste and timing of the deal in the midst of the ongoing political turmoil. \u201cWe had reasons to do it now, and it was not to appease anyone. By March 31, we were obligated to open a conditional standby letter of credit (SBLC) in favour of Antofagasta for $900m. Funds will now be released once the legalisation process is complete,\u201d Mr Tarin said. Further details of the deal have yet to surface, but, according to the available information, the federal and Balochistan governments will collectively hold a 50 per cent stake in the project and Barrick Gold will keep the other half. The federal government will pool in $1bn for 50pc stakes, covering also for Balochistan government for the initial $2bn investment in the project. In addition, the government of Balochistan will get 2pc royalty from the sales proceeds.On the question of the funding requirement of $1bn, the minister said the group of state-owned enterprises participating in the project would furnish the pledged amount.The National Party, a mainstream political party of the restive province, instantly opposed the deal, terming it \u201canti-people and anti-Balochistan\u201d. A senior economist, who wished not to be named, said: \u201cyou can\u2019t blame the people of Balochistan for having suspicions. This is what happens when you sell wheat to Balochistan at the international price and buy their gas at a fraction of the price you pay to Qatar.\u201dContinuing, he said government functionaries in the relevant department in Balochistan and in Islamabad know how the TCC in the 2000s tried to buy its way through when challenged for the breach of the Reko Diq contract.A former commerce secretary conceded that the burden of turning the case upside down, with Pakistan being penalised in international arbitration court, falls on the recklessness of over-confident government functionaries.A legal expert, who followed the arbitration process from close quarters and have been critical of the government\u2019s lack of capacity to deal with commercial disputes, said the new mining deal ought to be weaker than the earlier one.  \u201cA deal negotiated in desperation can\u2019t possibly be the best,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe devil is in the details. It would be stupid to expect global mining giants to write off big fines because of the goodness of their hearts. They must have extracted big concessions from Pakistan against guaranteed returns manifold more than what they have decided to forego. The government should make the key deal public for proper scrutiny by legal and technical experts,\u201d he stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s an old habit of the rulers to bend backwards to accommodate overseas investors. I am keen to find out tax holidays and other concessions rolled out this time round,\u201d he remarked.\u201cThe deal might not be ideal, but, if finalised, it will open many doors for foreign investment in Pakistan. Global investors did take note of the green signal to Barrick in Pakistan. I expect a rush of mining companies if things move ahead smoothly,\u201d said a mineral mining expert though he regretted the exclusion of private Pakistani mining companies from the Reko Diq deal.\u201cHad the local mining companies given a chance to be part of the project, they could have ensured greater transparency and swift movement of the project. The state-owned enterprises [Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum and Government Holdings Pakistan] have no experience in mineral mining and may falter,\u201d he argued.The effort to develop mineral reserves in Balochistan, initiated in 1992, did not go much beyond some feasibility reports that confirmed underground riches. The cost of this lingering 30-year exercise, mired in controversies, was steep as it stained the country\u2019s image, cost it heavy in penalties and blunted the thrust towards developing the vast mineral sector for the benefit of the most impoverished people in the richest province of the country.  All attempts to reach Barrick Gold executives for a comment did not succeed. Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

It has been facilitated by the PSX through its KiTS (Karachi Internet Trading System) platform which is the basis of the online trading applications and software provided by brokerage houses to their clients.The system enables investors to view their cash position, trade summaries, trade confirmations and custody position at the click of a button. The missing link was that the opening of an account was not online which was introduced in January 2021.With the advancement in technology, the Covid-19 outbreak, and the Roshan Digital Account platform being launched which facilitated fulfilling know-your-customer (KYC) requirements online, online account opening was the next step on the path of innovation and progress.The PSX is making efforts with the SECP to make the KYC requirement into a unified system whereby there will be a singular database that can be sharedFurthermore, the PSX, along with its cohorts in the capital markets, is making efforts with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan to make the KYC requirement into a unified system whereby banks and other market entities will have a singular database which they would be able to share and utilise for account opening of applicants.This will make redundant the process of initiating KYC formalities every time an individual wants to open an account with any of the market entities.Already, there are more than 50 brokerage houses that are offering an online account opening facility. Prospective investors can choose from a range of brokerage houses by going through the list on the PSX website.The process of online account opening is a simple one. It involves filling out the online account opening form available on the brokers\u2019 website, filling in the necessary details and submitting requisite documents online. The documents required for online account opening are:Copy of valid and attested computerised national identity cards(CNIC)/national identity card for overseas Pakistanis (NICOP)/alien registration cards (ARC)/Pakistan origin card (POC)/passport of the main applicants. Copy of valid and attested CNIC/NICOP/ARC/POC/passport of the joint applicants. Copy of valid and attested CNIC/NICOP/ARC/POC/passport of the nominee (optional \u2014 only for Single Accounts). An attested copy of power of attorney (if the contact person is other than the main applicant), duly attested by a notary public Employee card/job card for salaried person. Company\u2019s letterhead for business individuals mentioning the name, CNIC, designation etc. Salary slip for salaried persons. Income statement for Business individuals or monthly income mentioned on the company\u2019s letterhead. Copy of utility bill/driving license/insurance policy/rent agreement (If the address is not as per CNIC). Copy of zakat declaration of the applicant and the joint applicant (if applicable). In the case of a non-Muslim, an affidavit shall be submitted. Note: non-resident/ foreigners shall submit the documents duly attested by either notary public or consul general of Pakistan having jurisdiction over the applicant(s).After the documents are submitted, the back-end process begins. The documents are verified by the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL) and a verification code is generated and communicated via SMS by NCCPL to the customer to complete and acknowledge the verification. The customer can then submit his payment cheque to the brokerage house in order to begin investing in securities listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange.With about 50 per cent of the local populace living in rural and far-flung areas, the online account opening facility is a definitive method for enabling the peripherally located population to also take part in the investment scene on the stock market without having to travel all the way to a brokerage house physically. Similarly, for overseas Pakistanis, this is also a very valid option of account opening as this will allow them to access Pakistan\u2019s capital market while they are living abroad. nThe contents of this article comprising of information pertaining to financial products, including but not limited to securities, derivatives products, listed companies or companies proposed to be listed on PSX and any content of third parties are strictly of a general nature and are provided for informative and educational purposes only.

{"title": ["Hamza Shehbaz elected Punjab CM after garnering 197 votes in session marred by melees, chaos"], "author": ["Dawn.com"], "content": ["PML-N's Hamza Shehbaz has been elected the new chief minister of Punjab following a chaotic session at the provincial assembly that saw Deputy Speaker Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari attacked and PML-Q leader Chaudhry Parvez Elahi get injured.Hamza garnered 197 votes to beat Elahi \u2014 his rival, whose party PML-Q and ally PTI boycotted the election that began after more than five hours of delay following a number of altercations and melees on the floor of the House throughout the day.Announcing the results of the election, the deputy speaker said the day represented a \"success of democracy\" and lauded the \"positive role\" of the MPAs who took part in the voting despite today's events.In his maiden speech as the chief minister of the province, Hamza said his victory belonged to every lawmaker still seated in the assembly and thanked his allies for their support. He said he would not \"pursue revenge\" and would instead work to serve the people and benefit them \u2014 terming it as the \"best [form of] revenge\". The newly elected chief minister said he would make price committees functional and that dialysis machines lying useless in hospitals would be repaired. He said a modern local government system would also be introduced in Punjab.PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz congratulated her cousin on winning the election. \"Brothers and sisters of Punjab, the mandate that was stolen from you during the 2018 election has been returned to you once more,\" she declared, adding that the people would get their due rights.\t\t\tThe session was scheduled to begin at 11:30am but got underway a little after 5pm, following which the deputy speaker ordered that the doors of the legislature be closed and commenced the proceedings for voting.Prior to the resumption of the session, television footage showed Elahi being given oxygen while his right forearm was bandaged. He alleged that PML-N MPA Rana Mashood broke his hand. \"During his (Shehbaz's) exile, I took care of Hamza [Shehbaz] but today he showed his reality,\" he said. \"This is Sharif's democracy. They have crossed the limits today.\"\t\t\tElahi later told  that PML-N had \"taken revenge\" from him today and and accused Punjab Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan of acting directly on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's directives. \"He (Shehbaz) sent the IG to the House. Police can never enter the House. This has happened for the first time in the history of Pakistan,\" he said. \"The court does not listen to me either,\" Elahi complained.Earlier, slogans were chanted by both the parties, while PTI members threw  at the opposition benches, leading to open altercations and fights on the floor of the house.When Mazari entered the assembly, members of the treasury benches threw  at him and tried to circle him, while one of the MPAs pulled his hair and others were seen taking shots at him. Mazari was immediately shifted to his chamber by assembly guards. \t\t\tTo control the situation inside the house, Punjab SSP Operations along with a huge contingent of police officers entered the assembly in civil clothes but later exited the hall after protests from Elahi. \t\t\tMeanwhile, the Punjab chief secretary and IG held a meeting inside Mazari's chamber to chalk out a plan to resume the PA session. Later in the day, officers of the Anti-riots Force, clad in bulletproof jackets, entered the Punjab Assembly via its old gate after the deputy speaker summoned them through a letter written to chief secretary and IG Punjab.In a media talk outside the Punjab Assembly following the ruckus, PML-N leader Attaullah Tarar blamed Elahi and his \"group of gangsters\" for everything that happened inside the legislature. \"What happened today was a huge violation of the law and Constitution,\" he said. \"Today, the deputy speaker was attacked. This is an incident of terrorism. I have heard Chaudhry Parvez Elahi wants to get one or two people murdered.\" He added that Elahi had been encouraging the MPAs when they attacked the deputy speaker. Tarar called on the Lahore High Court to take suo motu notice of the incident and initiate action against the culprits. \"We are here and won't move till midnight.\"Meanwhile, Elahi blamed the PML-N for bringing the police inside the legislature \"for the first time since the creation of assemblies\". \"Who is police to enter the assembly?\" the PML-Q leader said. \"We will make sure the inspector general of police (IGP) appears before us and he will be punished for a month.\"He said that under the Constitution, the courts can't interfere in assembly proceedings. Speaking to the media, he said that the whole issue started when the court intervened in the matter and questioned how it could dictate what could and could not happen during proceedings.\"The powers of the deputy speaker lie with the speaker of the assembly,\" he said, adding that the speaker could delegate his powers.He said he had delegated his powers to the deputy speaker as he was contesting the election for the chief minister of the province. \"I stepped down for the sake of free and fair elections. [But] if the deputy speaker misuses his powers on the wrongful backing of the courts, it was going to be challenged.\"He went on to say that when the Lahore High Court gave the order allowing the deputy speaker to conduct the session, they suspended his powers as speaker of the house. \"This is illegal,\" he said.He added that the real \"fight\" ensued after police entered the assembly, which had not happened before in the country's history. \"In my opinion, there can be no bigger stain on democracy than this,\" he said.He regretted the fact that treasury lawmakers were bribed into changing sides after being promised money and ministries. \"They were shifted to three hotels and from there they were brought [to the assembly] in buses.\"The attack on Mazari and the ruckus inside the provincial assembly was strongly crticised by the government and PML-N leaders. Taking to Twitter, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the attack on the deputy speaker \"must be condemned in strongest terms possible\" and declared the violence inside the assembly \"fascism\". \t\t\t PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz followed suit and called out PTI for resorting to \"hooliganism\" in the face of defeat. \"No matter what you do, the right of Punjab will be given to it today,\" she promised. \t\t\tPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that the attack on the PA deputy speaker was an attack on the courts who had ruled to conduct the election today, the democracy, the Constitution, the federation and the people of South Punjab.\t\t\tPML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal said, \"Imran Niazi is hell-bent [on creating] anarchy at all levels.\" He added that the former prime minister was trying to follow Hitler's disciple. \t\t\t PML-N's Rana Sanaullah, on the other hand, demanded action be taken against PTI and PML-Q leaders for \"desecrating the assembly\". \t\t\tMeanwhile, writer Hina Parvez Butt cautioned that what happened in the assembly today was seen across the world. \"The image of Pakistan is being lowered,\" she regretted. \t\t\tThe Punjab Assembly ruckus was also denounced in the  today and a resolution was passed which demanded that the \"trend of violence\" must be stopped. A tough contest is expected for the top slot between the ruling coalition (PMLQ and PTI) candidate Parvez Elahi and PML-N's Hamza Shehbaz, who is the joint opposition's candidate. Both candidates, along with their supporters, had arrived at the PA in the morning.Elahi is currently the speaker of the house but since he is one of the candidates for chief minister, he cannot preside the session.Elaborate security arrangements have been made in and around the assembly to prevent any untoward incident before and after the chief minister\u2019s election. Paramilitary Rangers have also been called in to support police.Ahead of the proceedings, Mazari, who had been  to his position after the Lahore High Court overturned Speaker Elahi\u2019s order of withdrawing his powers, told journalists that he would ensure \"fair and transparent\" elections were held today. \"I have given media persons access to the assembly so that they can see how the proceedings are held,\" he said. The deputy speaker stated there might be efforts to further delay the voting but \"remember I won't take pressure\".In today's session, he revealed, everyone would be allowed to vote including defecting MPAs. \"According to Article 63-A, defectors will be allowed to vote. After the session, the party chief will see what needs to be done with them,\" Mazari added. Meanwhile, the PTI-PML-Q candidate, Elahi, expressed his distrust in Mazari saying that today's sitting would prove if he was honest or had \"other intentions\". Earlier, he had also accused the deputy speaker of taking money from Hamza. To be elected as chief minister, a candidate would need at least 186 votes in the 371-member house. In the Punjab Assembly, the PTI has 183 lawmakers, PML-Q 10, PML-N 165, PPP seven, five are independent and one belongs to Rah-i-Haq.The decisive factor in the election is expected to be the support of dissident PTI lawmakers that are part of the Jahangir Tarin and Aleem Khan groups, which have the support of around 24 lawmakers. Both groups have already announced they are backing opposition candidate Hamza Shehbaz.Meanwhile,   that the PTI coalition candidate Parvez Elahi had failed to muster the support of 186 MPAs required to win the chief minister election, and was now hoping that the joint opposition would also not be able to show the magic number. According to a dissident PTI member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the PML-Q\u2019s only hope is that the opposition fails to show 186 MPAs for Hamza Shehbaz\u2019s election and both sides may then go for a \u2018run-off\u2019 election and show a higher number of MPAs on its side.  \u201cAll the 24 dissident [PTI] MPAs are standing with the opposition as they were hurt by their party leaders in its three years and eight months rule in the Centre and Punjab,\u201d the MPA added.Elahi's spokesman Fayyazul Hassan Chohan said that the candidate having 186 votes would become chief minister and if no one shows the magic number, any candidate who has the support of more members would become the Punjab chief minister.He urged the dissident MPAs to return to their party as they, under the law, would not get any benefit from the PML-N government. Instead, Chohan said, they would be unseated and disqualified through a process by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).  He claimed that the dissident MPAs had started contacting Elahi as they were being pressurised by their families due to former PM Imran Khan\u2019s popularity in the public.  The Punjab Assembly had to elect the new leader of the house after Usman Buzdar's resignation last month. However, the elections have been stalled since. Since Elahi was contesting for the CM elections, he could not assume his role as the speaker of the assembly, after which the speaker's role was passed on to the deputy speaker. The voting, which was first supposed to held on April 3, was adjourned for three days because of a ruckus between the opposition and government lawmakers inside the assembly. Later, Deputy Speaker Mazari issued another notification, delaying the session further to April 16.However, in a late night development on April 5, Mazari superseded his earlier order and summoned the assembly to meet at 7:30pm on April 6  \u2014 a development that was denied by a spokesperson for the provincial assembly and the PML-Q.Mazari's sudden change of heart to hold the session earlier than April 16 was termed the \u2018handiwork\u2019 of the PML-N leadership that allegedly wooed him through a \u2018good offer\u2019. Amidst confusion on whether or not the session would take place on April 6, Elahi, using his powers as speaker, declared the deputy speaker's \u2018order\u2019 to summon the session \u2018illegal\u2019.The PML-Q leader had also ordered withdrawal of powers delegated to Mazari while a no-confidence motion was also submitted against him by his own fellow lawmakers in the PTI-PML-Q coalition. Meanwhile, the assembly premises was sealed with barbed wires and a police contingent deployed outside. Opposition lawmakers, who wanted to go inside the premises to conduct proceedings could not do so. As a result, the joint opposition held a mock session of its own at a private hotel in Lahore on April 6, where the PML-N claimed Hamza was \"elected\" as the chief minister, bagging 199 votes.The matter was, subsequently, taken to the Lahore High Court by Hamza. He demanded \"free and fair\" elections be held immediately. During the hearings that followed, LHC CJ Ameer Bhatti restored Mazari's powers and instructed him to hold the elections on the fixed date of April 16. However, the decision was challenged by Elahi. Yesterday, a two members bench comprising Justice Shujaat Ali Khan and Justice Jawad Hassan rejected the PML-Q leader's plea and directed the deputy speaker to conduct the elections. The bench also instructed Mazari to facilitate national/international observers, media persons, representatives of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, Free and Fair Election Network and other organisations during the election.Additionally, it ordered the Punjab chief secretary and provincial police chief to ensure foolproof security for the election today.

The platform is still working in Pakistan, however.Freedom of speech advocates have long criticised the creeping government censorship and control of Pakistan's internet and media.Dating apps have been blocked and last year, Pakistani regulators had asked YouTube to immediately block all videos they considered \u201cobjectionable\u201d from being accessed in the country, a demand criticised by rights campaigners.TikTok also removed more than seven million accounts of users suspected of being under age 13 in the first three months of 2021, it said in a report.The app said it took down nearly 62m videos in the first quarter for violating community standards \u2014 including for \u201chateful\u201d content, nudity, harassment or safety for minors.In its first disclosure on underage users, TikTok said it uses a variety of methods, including a safety moderation team, that monitors accounts where users are suspected of being untruthful about their age.Those age 12 or younger are directed to \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d in the United States.TikTok's transparency report said that in addition to the suspected underage users, accounts from nearly four million users additionally were deleted for violating the app's guidelines.

{"title": ["Is Pakistan the next big market for tech startups?"], "author": ["Dawn.com"], "content": ["Pakistan may be Asia's next big tech startup market, according to a  published by Germany's   on Wednesday.According to , Pakistan's young population and increasing levels of local capital are creating opportunities for tech entrepreneurs to explore the country's market.Pakistan has been named one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia in McKinsey & Co's latest report on the Pakistani ecosystem,  said.Quoting the same report,  said that 720 startups have been created in the country since 2010 \u2014 67 per cent of which are still operational.Presenting an example of how Pakistan's startup scene is garnering support worldwide, the  article said that Egyptian ride-hailing company, Swvl, has recently disclosed plans to invest $25 million in Pakistan's tech sector over the next two years to fund pre-seed startups and create 10,000 jobs.The article further pointed out that the startup industry \"is central to government plans to create an enabling environment [...] and stimulate economic growth\" and that in the latter half of 2019, Pakistan passed six reforms focused on creating a better environment for tech-based businesses in the country. These measures look to ease the regulatory environment for businesses, including the introduction of a three-year tax relief and creating an online one-stop registration system, through which \"companies can now be incorporated in 17 days, rather than 20, at a reduced cost of 1.1pc,\" the  said.According to , these reforms seem to be effective as \"Pakistan's position in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business report jumped from 136th place in 2018 to 108th place in 2019\".The article \u2014 while pointing out that startups in Pakistan raised $18.8 million in funding in 2019 \u2014 said that \"more capital is expected to flow into startups from overseas in the ensuing years\".The  article also welcomed the launch of the 'Digital Pakistan' initiative in December 2019. The initiative \u2014 headed by former Google executive Tania Aidrus \u2014 has the agenda to increase access and connectivity, enhance digital education and introduce a new era of e-governance in Pakistan.\"Pakistan's tech ecosystem has been slowly gaining momentum in the last few years. It's home to a strong tech talent base and it's still competitively affordable, which makes it ideal for early-stage founders like myself,\" Hena Husain, founder of London-based communications startup, The Content Architects, was quoted by  as saying. According to Hena, the growth in Karachi's tech market is increasing by the day. The Content Architects work with a development team based in Karachi. According to , confidence in Pakistan's tech market has led to an increase in the availability of local capital. \"While Pakistan's startup scene and venture capital market is still relatively new, the number of funds \u2014 such as i2i Ventures and Fatima Gobi Ventures \u2014 and active angel investors have increased significantly since 2018,  said.While trying to find out where Pakistan's tech revolution has sprung out from,  quoted Iskander Pataudi \u2014 a Pakistan-born tech professional working in Berlin \u2014 as saying that the tech scene in the country evolved organically. \"A few Pakistani tech startups have raised huge funding rounds at a time where our economy is just keeping its head above water,\" he was quoted as saying. \"This makes sense, considering we have a huge market of young, digitally-savvy consumers and increased 3G and 4G connectivity.\"Quoting Rabeel Warraich \u2014 founder of Pakistan-based venture capital fund Sarmayacar \u2014  said that a string of startup success stories, combined with a more stable political landscape under President Imran Khan, has increased \"investors' confidence that Pakistan holds huge potential for exiting businesses.\"According to , Pakistani nationals living overseas are beginning to believe that new avenues of opportunity are opening up back home.

{"title": ["Meta's Facebook to pay $90m to settle privacy lawsuit over user tracking"], "author": ["Reuters"], "content": ["Facebook agreed to pay $90 million to settle a decade-old privacy lawsuit accusing it of tracking users' internet activity even after they logged out of the social media website.A proposed preliminary settlement was filed on Monday night with the US District Court in San Jose, California, and requires a judge's approval. The accord also requires Facebook to delete data it collected improperly.Users accused the Meta Platforms Inc unit of violating federal and state privacy and wiretapping laws by using plug-ins to store cookies that tracked when they visited outside websites containing Facebook \u201clike\u201d buttons.Facebook then allegedly compiled users' browsing histories into profiles that it sold to advertisers.The case had been dismissed in June 2017, but was revived in April 2020 by a federal appeals court, which said users could try to prove that the Menlo Park, California-based company profited unjustly and violated their privacy.Facebook's subsequent effort to persuade the US Supreme Court to take up the case was unsuccessful. The company denied wrongdoing but settled to avoid the costs and risks of a trial, according to settlement papers.Settling \u201cis in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we're glad to move past this issue,\u201d Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri said in an email.The settlement covers Facebook users in the US who between April 22, 2010 and September 26, 2011 visited non-Facebook websites that displayed Facebook's \u201clike\u201d button.Lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to seek legal fees of up to $26.1m, or 29 per cent, from the settlement fund. The lawsuit began in February 2012.Ober the years, Facebook has faced other privacy complaints.In July 2019, it agreed to bolster privacy safeguards in a US Federal Trade Commission  that also included a $5 billion fine.On Monday, Texas' attorney general sued Meta, claiming it collected facial recognition data without users' permission.

{"title": ["Is Nadra keeping your biometric data safe?"], "author": ["Shaheera Jalil Albasit"], "content": ["Pakistan maintains one of the world\u2019s largest centralised citizen databases, which continues to expand at an unprecedented rate. This mammoth task sounds impressive, but it also raises concerns about the vulnerability of our data.There is no denying the database\u2019s utility. Multi-layered digitisation of big data can offer guarantees for greater transparency. Indeed, in the best-case scenario, sophisticated mobilisation of big data can refine the state\u2019s service delivery mechanisms.The Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), for instance, is one biometric transition success story in Pakistan. The BISP\u2019s increasing automation reflects how biometric verification of credentials acknowledges the non-static, dynamic nature of data. The programme facilitates nearly 5.3 million women in accessing welfare support through real-time thumbprint recognition. These concerns are not unfounded considering the exceedingly vigilant security regime under which rights defenders, citizen activists, and journalists operate in Pakistan\u2019s data territory. Given the size of biometrically-contained human records in the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) repository and the extent to which data-sharing occurs across, between, and beyond government agencies and LEAs, the scale of this vulnerability is likely to be huge.With Computerised National Identification Cards (CNICs) as testaments of having our consolidated biometric data stored with principally a single entity; and with an inevitably recurrent use of this CNIC and of biometrically-registered SIM cards while conducting our daily consumer mobility and monetary interactions, the ideals of free movement and of unmonitored human communication for the citizens, are breached in their fundamental. It can be rationally imagined that only when surveillance on communications is regulated exhaustively and when limitations on the jurisdiction of this surveillance are very thoroughly defined \u2013 which is possible when there are efficient legal protections accessible to all citizens indiscriminately \u2013 the privacy of citizens and the democratic guarantees that their personal data are not exploited, will not be threatened.\t\t\t\nThe simple fact is that biometric data management is yet to mature. Accidental data leakage, forgery with identification documents leading to identification theft and duplication, and inaccuracies in the handling of even legitimate documents, are insecurities of scale and have incredible damaging externalities.  These challenges are exacerbated when infrastructure and staff competencies in the use of biometric technology are not adequate and thorough. Opportunities which biometric data amassment has to offer, merit a pragmatic acknowledgement of existing structural and legal voids which prevent the prioritisation of the protection of individual privacy, and which continue to generate pressing questions on the efficacy of this technology for public development and responsive governance.In Pakistan, the space for an autonomous Privacy Commission gains prominence to respond to the critical need for the examination of an exceptionally large surveillance data. This need grows further in the scenario where the government is investing heavily in mass-scale digital surveillance of its citizens and visitors through projects like the Punjab Safe Cities Project (PSCP).  Similarly, the Islamabad Safe City Project (ISCP) gives LEAs sweeping intrusive powers through 24 hours of intensively-networked, real-time virtual monitoring with around 1,800 high definition Huawei CCTV cameras worth over Rs13 billlion installed in the capital city and connected to Nadra\u2019s centralised biometric repository. As shared by ISCP project director Dr Tahir Akram with , the project\u2019s command centre will be able to \u201cmonitor every car coming out of any residential sector in Islamabad\u201d. This arrangement between safe city projects and Nadra affords the kind of arbitrariness to data handlers that pervasively encroaches on the civil freedom of sociopolitically vulnerable sections of the citizenry, to claim anonymity. It therefore becomes important to question what guarantees are being supplied for the protection of this surveillance data during its retention with Nadra, and what extent of this retention carries involvement of Huawei\u2019s equipment.\t\t\t\nThe recently-enacted Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA, 2016) further legitimises the demand for independent data protection authorities and an increased jurisdiction of the National Commission for Human Rights as also outlined in the  jointly prepared by digital rights organisations Bytes for All, Pakistan, and Media Matters for Democracy. Simultaneously, it is crucially significant that the data-handling and investigative capacities of FIA\u2019s National Response Centre for Cyber Crimes, are rapidly evaluated and optimised. This will ensure that PECA is enforced keeping in view the local dynamics where the government has still not rolled out enough campaigns for the purpose of educating the cyberspace occupiers in the country about the legal implications of this law on their cyber rights and responsibilities.  Equally concerning is that PECA\u2019s language contains considerable opportunity for the subjectivity of the investigating regulator to claim a determinant jurisdiction. In the backdrop of Pakistan\u2019s dictatorial history with digital censorship and the political exploitation of the blasphemy law, to invest potentially unmonitored authority in a regulatory body, will make the ambiance of cyber expression only more precarious.  In its quite expansive coverage and criminalisation of cyber activism, it criminalises the act of whistleblowing. It also makes highly controversial way for a warrantless collection of one\u2019s personal digital data and its reproduction to Pakistan\u2019s foreign cooperation partners.With now a fiercer surveillance regime in place, Pakistan currently experiences one of the world\u2019s most desperate urgencies to ensure the presence and preparedness of an assertive oversight and transparency regime. In terms of transparency, it is expected of the federal and provincial governments to educate the public on the use of their Right to Information for greater documentation on surveillance practices, to be brought into the public domain.\t\t\t\nShaheera Jalil Albasit is Sabika Sheikh\u2019s cousin-sister.

{"title": ["Apple unveils new premium iPhone XS, health features for watch"], "author": ["AFP"], "content": ["Apple on Wednesday unveiled updated versions of its priciest iPhones along with a new smartwatch that allows users to take their own electrocardiograms, as the US tech giant looks to boost its momentum in a sputtering market. The California tech giant revealed its iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, updating the top-of-the line handsets released a year earlier. The new devices are aimed at maintaining Apple's share in the premium segment. \u201cWe are going to take iPhone X to the next level,\u201d chief executive Tim Cook said at a media event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California. The new phones have displays of 5.8 and 6.5 inches, boosting screen size while keeping a small-format handset, Apple vice president Phil Schiller said. The September event allows the company to unveil its latest offerings before the key holiday shopping season. While the iPhone has made Apple the world's most valuable company, worth more than $1 trillion, it has slipped to third place among smartphone makers as Chinese-based Huawei has grabbed the number two spot. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said Apple had done enough \u201cto keep its smartphone growth going until the competition responds.\u201d Apple also introduced a fourth generation of Apple Watch with a major redesign -- and a series of features designed to improve its performance as a medical and health device. The watch, sold in the United States from $399 and up, will be available in stores on September 21. \u201cApple Watch has become an intelligent guardian for your health,\u201d chief operating officer Jeff Williams said. He highlighted a major innovation -- the watch's ability to perform an electrocardiogram. \u201cThis is the first ECG product offered over the counter directly to consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you can take an ECG any time, anywhere, right from the wrist.\u201d The device also detects when a person suffers a fall, seen as an important feature for elderly or disabled users. \u201cIdentifying a fall may sound like a straightforward problem, but it requires a lot of data analysis,\u201d Williams said. If a person falls, and then is motionless, the watch will call emergency services, he added. Research firm CB Insights said Apple is at a \u201ccrossroads\u201d a decade after introducing the iPhone. \n\u201cLooking for the next wave, Apple is clearly expanding into augmented reality and wearables with the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones,\u201d the firm said.\u201cBut the next 'big one' -- a success and growth driver on the scale of the iPhone -- has not yet been determined. Will it be augmented reality, auto, wearables? Or something else entirely?\u201d Apple's event comes with the global smartphone market largely saturated, without a major catalyst for sales ahead of a likely rollout of 5G, or fifth generation, wireless networks, expected in 2019. Research firm IDC expects worldwide smartphone shipments to decline 0.7 percent in 2018 to 1.455 billion units, with growth likely to resume as 5G devices become available. Cook said Apple was nearing its two billionth device for its mobile operating system known as iOS. \u201cWe are about to hit a major milestone. We are about to ship our two billionth iOS device,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is astonishing -- iOS has changed the way we live. \u201c Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

{"title": ["Meet the 26-year-old Pakistani who founded a multi-million dollar company"], "author": ["Mehreen Omer"], "content": ["What does it take for a man to reach his full potential? Good advice \u2013 more than anything else. And this was exactly what Bilal Ather got during his journey in creating  \u2013 a tool that gives free Wi-Fi to customers in exchange for their information. It is a software that operates on a subscription based model, costing around $20 per month only per access point, and uses permission-based Facebook API to give user access.\t\t\t\nMr Bilal was just an ordinary guy who like many other A-Levels students was not sure about his future. He figured out very early that he did not want to go to a university. He then planned to get an ACCA degree and decided to become an auditor. But this did not work out.Thinking that a career as a rock guitarist might be the thing for him because he had participated in several school gigs before, he decided to try his luck in singing. But Mr Bilal was counselled by his father who being a good mentor told him he would not be able to have a stable career in singing, rather he should utilise his other talent, in computers.He first used a computer when he was only 5 years old. This was where his passion for the world of computing began.Then, a friend from England told him to take a certification in Cisco and work in networking technology. He went on to complete two CCIE certifications.Still 21 years of age, he was used to getting many job offers. He even turned down the offer of a big telecommunication company in Saudi Arabia and rather chose to do a job in Beaconhouse. But thankfully within six months of his work there, he realised that his talent was being wasted and his job role was not utilising his Cisco expertise at all.A company from Abu Dhabi called him to give training sessions in Cisco. This company also specialised in disaster recovery solutions. After gaining some experience, Mr Bilal left the company to form his own company \u2013 Ikhtira Systems \u2013 in Multan, a city chosen specifically because there was no competition in disaster recovery services there. Lahore already had so many companies doing similar work. His company\u2019s name \u2018Ikhtira\u2019 was taken from a band he was a part of in high school. But just like the band, the company suffered heavy losses and failed within 10 months of operations.Mr Bilal was distraught; he did not want to go back home and ask his parents for support. People used to look up to him and appreciate the fact that he started a company at 22, and now they were making fun of him. He did not even have money to buy lunch for three consecutive days.Destiny then led him to a guy who told him to start freelancing on the Internet. He had a network of very supportive friends in Multan. Even though, he did not have money to buy his own Internet service, being the geeky genius he was, he started hacking into other people\u2019s Wi-Fi. Freelancing started making him some money. He got his first project in 10 days and although he only made $35 for his first project, he was relieved that at least now, he was earning something. \u201cThings then started moving in a good direction. Freelancing really helped,\u201d he recalls.With the confidence of some money in his pocket, he went back home and started living with his family in Vehari. But his parents were upset with his routine. He used to sleep all day and work all night. His parents worried that no girl would marry him if he continued like this. Mr Bilal then got the opportunity to move to Lahore. He started helping Arfa Karim\u2019s parents in setting up their institution in Plan9. He didn\u2019t charge them any money, just utilised the space for his own work. By this time, he had started working on Wifigen already.During his freelancing gigs, Mr Bilal got a project from someone who turned out to be John Russell Patrick, the ex-VP of IBM. He pitched Wifigen\u2019s idea to him, but although John liked the idea, he said that he did not invest in early-stage companies. Mr Bilal was nonetheless adamant that Mr John could at least mentor him. Thus, began the journey of a mentor turning into an investor.Mr Bilal then went on to do a project for another lady who had her own consultancy company in New Zealand. She introduced him to someone who wanted to be a reseller for this product in New Zealand, but was told to complete the product in two months. Mr Bilal argued that he needed funds to complete it in such a short period. The reseller in New Zealand agreed to fund the project without taking any equity. A lucky break, you may call it. He then hired some people on freelancer.com to help him build his product within 45 days. The proposed timeline for project completion was 60 days. This left a 15 days leverage to further test the product and eradicate any flaws.But that was not enough for him. He was surprised to find that anyone could apply at Plan9. It was a very open community that really motivated him. He went on to launch his own company in New Zealand. Within three months of incubation, he raised funding from his old mentor, Mr John.Then during a business trip to Singapore, he met a representative from Changi Airport who was really interested in deploying Wifigen on their airport. Mr Bilal then started beta testing Wifigen on Singapore\u2019s airport. Later on, he got Unilever Pakistan on board too. But this was only the beginning. He signed on the biggest deal in the history of Wi-Fi at Tahiti Island, which wanted to use Wifigen to give a better experience to tourists. Wifigen then was seen as a product with a huge application in the tourism industry.Mr Bilal has been trying to integrate artificial intelligence with Wi-Fi for the last three months. He realises that machine learning is necessary to make things easy for the advertisers and the people who will be using its Wi-Fi. It will allow the advertisers to know exactly who the end user is and how deep his pockets are, so they can accordingly pitch them different products.He wishes to move into more markets as business expansion will be the key driver of Wifigen\u2019s success. His company currently has a multi-million dollar valuation while trying to raise another round of investment. For all those aspiring entrepreneurs out there, he has only one thing to say: \u201cKeep failing until you are ready to change the world.\u201d\nThis piece first appeared on  and has been reproduced with permission.\t\t\t\nMehreen Omer is a digital media scientist, a technology buff and a cultural critic.

Yousaf Haroon, said: \u201cShiv Sena\u2019s attack on Indian cricket\u2019s headquarters in Mumbai, cancellation of PCB chairman\u2019s meeting with BCCI president, [hurling] threats to Aleem Dar from officiating matches [in India] and ICC\u2019s decision to send him back compelled us to consider the matter of Pakistan\u2019s team security seriously.\u201dHaroon added that the Pakistan team had already started preparations for the event and the team had also been shortlisted but the \u201ccurrent scenario all of a sudden changed\u201d everything.The PBCC has officially informed the Cricket Association of the Blind in India (CABI) that Pakistan will not take part in the event.The drama began on Monday when the PCB chief Shaharyar Khan was due to meet his Indian counterpart Shashank Manohar.Manohar had invited Shaharyar to discuss the prospect of a bilateral series between the two countries. But before the meeting could start some workers of Shiv Sena stormed into the building protesting the PCB chief\u2019s visit and shouting anti-Pakistan slogans.Earlier, India\u2019s failure to provide security to Pakistan\u2019s commentators and match officials, following Shiv Sena\u2019s hooliganism, also forced Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar to quit the ongoing India-South Africa series and head home early.

This is unbelievable. Hard to come to grips with,\" Gavaskar said.\"Warne mastered a craft which is so difficult... wrist spin. To pick 700-plus wickets like he did in test cricket, hundreds more in one-day cricket tells you how good a bowler he was.\"Finger spin is a lot easier, you have more control over what you want to bowl but leg-spin or wrist spin is tough. For him to have bowled the way he did, the way he seemed to create magic... at will was the reason he was revered all over the cricketing world.\"Gavaskar said he did not consider Warne, who took 708 test wickets to sit behind Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan (800) in the overall list, as the greatest spinner of all time. \"For me, the Indian spinners and Muralitharan were certainly better than Warne. Because look at Warne's record against India. It was pretty ordinary against India,\" Gavaskar said.\"Because he didn't have much success against Indian players, who are very good players of spin bowling, I don't think I would call him the greatest. Muralitharan with the success that he had against India would rank over him in my book.\"The timing of Gavaskar's comments upset some of Warne's legion of Indian fans, particularly his suggestion that the Australian's lifestyle had contributed to his early death.\"He was always looking to live life fully, king-size as they call it and he did that and maybe because he lived life in such a manner is perhaps the reason why his heart couldn't take it and he passed away so soon,\" Gavaskar said.

Listening to what their hearts and minds desire and then creating the communication. It would have been just brilliant \u2013 and easy!Marketing to women is not as simple as putting pink on a label. The female segment of the market is an under-developed opportunity \u2013 possibly the number one opportunity \u2013 for people who understand what women really want; they are the primary consumers of products and services across multiple categories and responsible for buying or influencing the purchases of products for themselves and everyone around them: partners, children, elderly parents and friends.Men and women do not communicate in the same way and do not buy for the same reasons. He simply wants the transaction to take place; she is interested in developing a relationship. Women make a connection everywhere they go. They want to know what the product will do for them, how it will make their life easier. How do they get this information? By doing lots of research.Women are much more complex than what traditional marketing would have them be and their differences influence their worldview. Race, age, language, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, religion, and how these identities overlap, are significant factors when it comes to understanding women.Brands can sometimes miss how a woman\u2019s identity intersects with her experiences at each life stage. What she responds to and buys changes as she does. No two women\u2019s journeys are the same. There is only one common thread: women are the market. You cannot afford to ignore them.There is no special trick to marketing to women. Use common sense. Gather the data, recognise the diversity of their experiences, induct more women in your team and you may just begin to market to women through a more inclusive lens.Women have long been the primary target for many marketers, not only because they make up roughly half of the world\u2019s population, but because of their buying power. Although the data varies, it is believed that women drive 70 to 80% of all consumer purchasing decisions.\u00a0Although advertisers want to reach out to women, the tendency to objectify them remains. As someone who works in advertising, I can attest to the fact that way too much marketing still relies on outdated stereotypes and impossible beauty standards. The fact is that women are still being failed too frequently by the same industry that has been failing them for decades. Some brands still use the \u2018shrink it and pink it\u2019 strategy and ads routinely miss the mark with misrepresented gender roles. Brands need to realise that it is not difficult to reach them using diverse messaging that takes into account what it is like to be a woman today. All they need to do is work with women who know how to talk to other women. If you want to target women more meaningfully, start with the facts. There is a major disconnect when it comes to marketing to women. Many brands do not take the time to project the needs of women, their challenges, goals and their appearances. They are not designing their offerings with women in mind. They continue to hold on to antiquated marketing tactics, without considering the data. \u2018Pinkifying\u2019 the branding is not enough to connect authentically. Learning how to engage women requires paying attention to their diverse needs and perspectives. If you don\u2019t follow the data, you could fall behind with the\u00a0emerging generation of consumers. As women go through life they change. They may grow up in a particular neighbourhood or cultural tradition, but live their lives in another. Some begin college with one major and graduate with a degree in something else. Many jump head-first into careers then re-evaluate their professional goals after\u00a0becoming mothers. Some grow up thinking motherhood is inevitable, then decide not to have children. Marketing to women is less about gender and more about adding a human layer to the approach. It means prioritising people. Let the data guide you and try an intersectional approach. A simple and effective way to market to women is to integrate their stories into the messaging. What better way to connect with real women than to highlight their experiences? Every woman\u2019s journey is unique, and on the way, she encounters challenges and wins other women can relate to. Part of making your brand accessible to women is offering something that speaks to their needs and lets them know you are paying attention \u2013 it involves more than using a bunch of stock images of women and calling it a day. Explore the issues women face and provide a platform to promote awareness and change. Women want to be seen and want brands to meet them with solutions that speak to their needs. One of the best ways to market to women is to include women on your team \u2013 and not just one woman or one \u2018kind\u2019 of woman. Having women from different backgrounds at the table will ensure you target women with intention; this will enhance your offering because a diverse array of female voices will bring any gaps in the market to your attention.\u00a0 Female influencers know what kind of content their audience responds to, so allow the promoted content to be shared in their voice and style. Some influencers convey a relatable, everyday vibe, while others offer a more aspirational experience \u2014 either way, let your brand messaging shine through. However, think twice about embarking on any kind of campaign based on unrealistic body image claims, even if the influencer seems to occupy that space. Remember the backlash against Kim Kardashian\u2019s appetite suppressant lollipops? Women (especially Gen Z and Millennials) are tired of the toxic diet culture. The important thing is to be authentic. Effective influencer marketing is about real stories by real people. They should be an extension of the influencer\u2019s regular commentary. Women influencers who talk authentically about what matters to them are the best partners for brand sponsorships. The messaging should be organically woven into the conversation, rather than delivered as a sales pitch.\u00a0 The mistake advertisers make is assuming that all women respond to the same messaging. Influencer marketing allows you to target effectively and leaves no room for bland \u2018spray and pray\u2019 content. It enables you to drill down to the generational and life-stage differences that make up your audience. Content that taps into the strength, intelligence and diversity of the female experience will simplify portrayals, although there can never be a one-size-fits-all answer for what women respond to. Content should be targeted, relevant and valuable and with the right influencer, brands can powerfully leverage their messaging.\u00a0Selecting the right social media platform depends on the campaign KPIs and there are plenty of best practice tips for doing so. Pinterest can be ideal for recipes, DIY projects and craft how-tos. Stories on Instagram can be an engaging way to show a step-by-step process or fashion board. YouTube is popular for beauty tutorials. Facebook can drive deep engagement with paid boosting. TikTok is an emerging platform for light-hearted brand content and challenges. Using a mix of platforms and influencers often results in the best overall engagement and reach, with paid amplification as a great option for acquiring even stronger numbers.As more women move to top levels inside ad agencies, and clients understand how deep the reach of women consumers is across all market segments, the more likely it is that brands successfully align their marketing objectives with the needs of women shoppers. However, it is important to remember that effective advertising requires going beyond male or female demographics. Why people buy a product is more important than who they are, and the more you know about the men or women you are targeting, the more successful you will be.

{"title": ["Economic cost of political instability"], "author": ["Khaleeq Kiani"], "content": ["The prevailing political uncertainty arising out of a  against Prime Minister Imran Khan is leading to serious and lingering economic uncertainty. The global geo-political situation following the Russian invasion of Ukraine is having a multiplying effect.The combination of the two is like a culling machine. Foreign exchange reserves are falling as import bills on the back of oil prices grow, bond yields are increasing, and remittances are straightening out while financing needs increase amid rupee depreciation, double-digit inflation and stock exchange on a downhill path.This all is a source of perpetual pain for millions of citizens. But the biggest challenge for any government after the political turmoil settles down would be how to absorb the costs of policy distortions that have crept into the system over the past few weeks.It would cost a lot of political capital to reverse  on electricity and oil prices with a four-month freeze to pre-relief level once prudent economic sense prevails. The resultant increase in the circular debt and fiscal deficit otherwise will have their own lagged impact in the shape of inflation and higher debt. These cannot be wished away with delays and indecision.The fundamental economic challenges are back to square one despite a lot of pain absorbed by the citizens over the last couple of yearsAs if that is not enough, there is no clarity at all at this moment on how the domestic political and external factors behave in the near future. The possibilities in terms of survival of the current government, an interim government and the term of its tenure or the general elections and the future government have varying degrees of economic costs. The Ukraine crisis is already turning global economies upside down soon after the Covid-induced recession.The preoccupation with political crises is already having an impact on decision making and governance. The prime minister has not been able to hold a meeting of the federal cabinet for almost a month against the normal weekly schedule. Among the lost list of items on the agenda of the scheduled but cancelled cabinet meeting on March 1 included a mid-year review of the federal budget 2021-22 and key economic indicators. The normal workings at the federal secretariat have also been affected as bureaucrats adopt a \u2018wait & see approach\u2019 on day to day running of the government.That is also where the talks between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistan authorities remain inconclusive. While the initial objections revolved around populist moves, particularly the relief package, announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan last month, reversing a major impact of the mini-budget under IMF prior actions, the concerns have now shifted to the  of the ongoing IMF programme. Reneged IMF targets would come back to haunt future Pakistan governments and people in the shape of even more stringent prior actions.With the no-confidence move by the joint opposition, the scope of these concerns has rather expanded, adding fuel to the uncertainties. The more relevant anxieties now pertain to questions if an interim set-up could carry forward the remaining part of the Fund programme and whether or not it could return to the mini-budget announced in January and what if a future majority in parliament shuns ownership of the State Bank law.In such circumstances, the IMF staff may hesitate to bring up Pakistan\u2019s case before its executive board for the remaining tranches at least before the upcoming spring meetings in the third week of April. Perhaps because of such an eventuality, the government had taken a wish list of about $21 billion financial support from China during Prime Minister Khan\u2019s visit. This included about $4.3bn debt rollover maturing within the current month.Pakistan expected an arrangement with China with the consent of the IMF to have access to a part of the $40bn increased quota the Fund had allowed to China as part of its Covid-19 quota expansion to member countries. On return from Beijing, Prime Minister\u2019s Special Assistant on CPEC Affairs Khalid Mansoor had told a news conference that Chinese leadership took note of these requests and promised to consider and then communicate their decision accordingly in response to questions about Pakistan\u2019s request for the $4bn debt rollover, extension in currency swap from the existing $4.5bn to $10bn and $5.5bn in additional financial support.While authorities anxiously await a formal response, the political uncertainty may have some ramifications here too as Chinese leadership may like to steer clear of the situation. The current account deficit, in the meanwhile, has reached almost $12bn in the first seven months with full-year projections at around $18-19bn \u2014 a level the PTI had inherited in 2018.Even though the PTI government did not inherit an ideal situation, its indecision or delayed decision to go back to the IMF cost the country dearly. Amid tough stabilisation policy, the worst ever health pandemic rather came as a saving grace as international lenders, particularly the IMF, opted for an accommodative policy and provided additional financial assistance with almost no strings attached.But the authorities failed to push through long-standing structural reforms and instead came up with three money-whitening schemes. Also, it diverted more funds out of external support to big businesses rather than making them efficient and competitive. The belated increases in electricity rates aimed at containing circular debt have been brought back to a level initiated two years ago.The fundamental economic challenges are back to square one despite a lot of pain absorbed by the citizens over the last couple of years. Pakistan again stands at the crossroads it comes across every election cycle. The difference this time is that challenges are greater than before and remedies may also be even tougher as uncertainties prolong.  Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

{"title": ["Comment: Ramiz Raja as PCB chairman is yet another example of Pakistan snubbing way of the world"], "author": ["Syed Hammad Hasnain"], "content": ["Every now and then, don\u2019t we all find ourselves looking back at the past, wondering what we were thinking with that teenage hairdo, that impulsive purchase, that late night text or any number of things? We all have a personal collection of such thoughts, assembled with no great care and now an eternal source of piercing discomfort. Same replicates at national level, where we look back at wars fought, lives lost, loans borrowed and monies misspent. Some among us, the brooding kind, would cringe at such introspections and think what we might do differently if given a do-over. If only we had a time-travelling DeLorean.It never occurs to us that instead of dwelling in the past, why do we not live in the present and catch our mistakes in real time? That would save us a lifetime of regret, no? This philosophical opening applies to pretty much all and everything in life, including our beloved but painful world of Pakistan cricket, where a pair of dice was recently rolled and one face showed Ramiz, the other . It was Raja\u2019s turn to be smiled at by Lady Luck and \u2018selected\u2019 \u2014  by Prime Minister Imran Khan. In a few years\u2019 time, would this selection need rectification? Would another U-turn be taken? Would we reminisce or regret?But Raja does not represent the most random selection ever made by , for that title will probably never leave . Thus, no matter how badly some may want to, they cannot call the incoming PCB chairman a Buzdar plus \u2014 at least not for the randomness of it all.I do, however, have plenty to say on and critique his nomination, which might very well turn out to be a stroke of genius but it still wouldn\u2019t matter as the nomination isn't the product of a scientific process, but appears another one of those gut-feel decision.The premise of this piece is not to never be wrong. Hey, no one is infallible. Some of the brightest minds aided by the greatest of resources have made the biggest of blunders (Read the US invasion of Afghanistan).It\u2019s that high-risk, low-reward Hail Mary punt that is devoid of any logic and has no real history of success I have a problem with. While conventional wisdom and established way of the world suggest that sports administrators at the highest level need to be seasoned executives with plenty of management experience, Pakistan is once again attempting to defy logic by handing over the cricket board\u2019s reins to someone whose only administrative stint was back in 2003-4 when he had a largely forgettable 15-month-long term as a part-time . So forgettable that few in the industry even remember that episode. Ironically, he had replace another commentator in the position: Chishty Mujahid.During this time, he kept on commentating and made no secret of the fact that his media jobs were more important to him than running cricket in the country. When on the microphone, the lines would get murky and he\u2019d slate his cricketers more than any CEO should ever do publicly, causing murmurs in the dressing room. In April 2004, his and then chairman Shahryar Khan\u2019s combined (mis)handling of Shoaib Akhtar and accusing him of feigning injury \u2014 only for  he was indeed injured \u2014 did little to wrap them in glory. Since then, Raja has never even run a regional body, let alone a messy behemoth that PCB can easily become every other week.So when the world wants its cricket boards to be chaired by specialised personnel with loads of management experience acquired over a number of years at various levels, Pakistan cricket is still sticking to the policy of its policymakers being plucked out of thin air and given the job on a whim of one individual. Former athletes being given top administrative jobs just because of their knowledge of the game and proximity to the prime minister is a practice not practiced in any competitive sport, anywhere in the world. Look up who chairs the boards of widely successful football clubs in Europe, and all you\u2019d find are businessmen, lawyers, former brand executives and whatnot. You would struggle to find a former athlete with 15 months of unremarkable administrative experience, and none in the past 17 years, heading the entire operation. Forget football or other sports, for they are far too structured. Even in cricket, the top cricketing nations see their boards headed by professionals. The ECB is currently headed by Ian Whatmore \u2014 a management consultant. Before him was Colin Graves \u2014 an entrepreneur who founded a chain of stores for himself and then, when appointed the ECB chair,  a record \u00a31.1billion media rights deal to go with ODI World Cups in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s game.Cricket Australia Chairman  is an experienced business executive who\u2019s headed multiple corporations, whereas New Zealand Cricket Chairman Martin Snedden is a former cricketer but also a practicing lawyer and veteran administrator who had held roles not just in cricket but also in rugby prior to being put at the helm of affairs.Even Saurav Ganguly cut his administrative teeth a tier below and headed the Cricket association of Bengal for five years before given the nod to lead the BCCI.Sports administration today is a specialised field that is taught at universities and needs specific knowledge and nous. But in the Land of the Pure it is still a widely held belief that any and all jobs in cricket can be better performed by cricketers. What\u2019s forgotten is the fact that just because you scored runs does not mean you would also prove to be an effective cricket administrator, who could strike strategic partnerships, grow the game, increase revenues and also win the battle of politics and diplomacy.That said, best of luck to the incoming chairman, and let\u2019s hope we\u2019ve struck it lucky with him.

{"title": "Russia may be in default, says Moody\u2019s", "author": "Reuters", "content": "\nLONDON:\nMoody\u2019s said Russia may be in default because it tried to service its dollar bonds in roubles, which would be one of the starkest consequences to date of Moscow\u2019s exclusion from the Western financial system since President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.If Moscow is declared in default, it would mark Russia\u2019s first major default on foreign bonds since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, though the Kremlin says the West is forcing a default by imposing crippling sanctions.Russia made a payment due on April 4 on two sovereign bonds - maturing in 2022 and 2042 - in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the securities.Russia \u201ctherefore may be considered a default under Moody\u2019s definition if not cured by 4 May, which is the end of the grace period,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a statement on Thursday.\u201cThe bond contracts have no provision for repayment in any other currency other than dollars.\u201dMoody\u2019s said that while some Russian eurobonds issued after 2018 allow payments in roubles under some conditions, those issued before 2018 - such as those maturing in 2022 and 2042 - do not.\u201cMoody\u2019s view is that investors did not obtain the foreign-currency contractual promise on the payment due date,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.The Russian finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Izvestia newspaper earlier this month that if Russia is forced into a default, it will take legal action.Before Putin\u2019s February 24 order for what he casts as a special military operation in Ukraine, Russia was rated as investment grade. But its sovereign bonds have become a target in what the Kremlin says is an economic war waged by the United States.Russia in 1998 defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt and devalued the rouble under President Boris Yeltsin because it was effectively bankrupt after the Asian debt crisis and falling oil prices shook confidence in its short-term rouble debt.In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries under Vladimir Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt, shocking global debt markets because Russia then had one of the world\u2019s biggest foreign debt piles.This time, Russia has the money but cannot pay because the reserves - the world\u2019s fourth largest - that Putin ordered be built up for just such a crisis are frozen by the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada.DefaultAs Russia could not and would not borrow right now, a default would be largely symbolic, marking the tumultuous finale to its post-Cold War attempt to integrate into the West\u2019s financial architecture.While Russia has only $40 billion in international bonds outstanding across 15 dollar or euro-denominated issues, its corporates have built up vastly more foreign debt.The US Treasury this month halted Russia\u2019s ability to use foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at US financial institutions to pay its debt.\u00a0 The Kremlin says the West has already defaulted on its obligations to Russia by freezing its reserves, and that it wants a new system to replace the Bretton Woods financial architecture established by the Western powers in 1944.S&P earlier this month lowered Russia\u2019s foreign currency ratings to \u201cselective default\u201d on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debt holders.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s economy is heading for the worst contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, with soaring inflation and capital flight.

However, the officials available in the ministries are taking no action and told The Express Tribune that they were waiting for policy instructions from the new government.The fuel crisis is causing financial and production losses and industries are either using alternative expensive fuels like diesel or waiting for the normalisation of gas supplies, he said.Islamabad-based energy expert Ammar Khan said that a significant reduction in import of gas had been witnessed during the ongoing season for different reasons and continuous depletion of domestic gas reserves amid no new big discovery have led to the worsening of the gas crisis.He recalled that a couple of global gas suppliers, in violation of long-term agreements, had cancelled the scheduled shipments over the past few months after gas prices shot up in the world market.Similarly, Pakistan avoided buying expensive gas from global spot markets as gas imported under long-term agreements remained cheaper.Thirdly, the gas reserves have continued to deplete at a rate of around 9% per year in the country while exploration and production companies have failed to make a big discovery that can help overcome the crisis.Gas supplies from local fields stood at 3,427 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) during the week ended April 8, 2022, according to the latest numbers compiled and reported by Arif Habib Limited (AHL).Supplies were 5.3% higher compared to the previous week \u201camid resumption of production in Uch post-annual turnaround (ATA) at Uch Power Ltd II.\u201d\u201d\u201cPakistan meets almost 20% (1,200 mmcfd) of its gas requirement through imports, which have suffered delays,\u201d Khan pointed out.Gas prices are hovering around $20-22 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) in the global market while Pakistan supplies imported gas to its consumers at around $10 per unit.Authorities usually supply subsidised gas to the households. \u201cThe government should revise upwards the price of imported gas to make imports sustainable and overcome the crisis in the long run,\u201d he suggested.Secondly, the government should allow the setting up of new LNG import terminals, as the country has only two terminals at present, which are insufficient to meet the growing requirement for imported gas.Pakistan\u2019s total demand for gas is estimated at over 6,500 mmcfd against supplies of around 4,650 mmcfd. Gas marketing firms \u2013 Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) \u2013 manage the shortfall by resorting to outages of gas supplied to CNG fuel pumps and non-export industries.SSGC reported last week that some of its customers have complained of low gas pressure at Sehri (early morning) and Iftaar (evening).\u201cIt is important to mention that customers who are generally located at the tail end of the company\u2019s distribution lines are faced with low pressure issues due to sudden and manifold increase in gas use for cooking purposes in millions of homes and commercial outlets at similar timings.\u201dMoreover, the constantly depleting gas reserves and occasional operational issues in some gas fields have compounded the issue, resulting in widening of the demand-supply gap, it said.

On April 7, 2022, the rupee closed at an all-time low at Rs188.18 owing to speculation stemming from political turbulence in the country. Moreover, demand for the dollar stood higher compared to its supply in the wake of an expanding current account deficit, swelling imports and rising global commodity prices. Earlier, the announcement of $3 billion cash deposit by Saudi Arabia in the State Bank helped the rupee to appreciate, however, the recovery proved short-lived. The rupee had been on the downtrend since hitting 22-month high at Rs152.27 in May 2021. The SBP has injected $1.2 billion into the inter-bank market to defend the rupee in the ongoing fiscal year.
