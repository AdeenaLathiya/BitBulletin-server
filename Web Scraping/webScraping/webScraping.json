The events that ", " in the political arena of Pakistan were nothing less than those contests.", "The opening line of this article can perhaps be adapted to local circumstances: it is said that if you win the bureaucracy, you win Punjab and if you win Punjab, you win Pakistan. As prime minister, Imran Khan failed to recognise that winning edge. ", "Dr Ishrat Husain, who was adviser to the former prime minister on institutional reforms, in his book Governing the Ungovernable, writes that \u201cafter all it was the imperative track record of the Punjab government under the leadership of Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif during the 2008-13 period which won the votes for PML-N\u201d. He further goes on to narrate how nepotism and party loyalty undermined merit, which became the cause of disillusionment with the PML-N among the educated middle class that subsequently led to the rise of the PTI.", "Now coming to the fall of the PTI, the reasons for it might seem complex but, in fact, they are as simple as those of its rise. One of them is the inability of Imran Khan to deliver on his promise of good governance, especially in Punjab. He was unable to truly win the support of the bureaucracy and to motivate the latter to go beyond the line of duty to sincerely work for the people.", "The bureaucracy saw Imran Khan as a threat, as someone ready to throw it under the bus to pursue an absolutely political agenda. This perception cemented the image of the former prime minster as someone in whose tenure civil servants had to lie low, stay idle, pass time in as uneventful a manner as possible so that they did not end up in trouble. Except for a handful of civil servants serving directly with the former prime minister, this was the general idea in the bureaucracy, and sadly, in his tenure that spanned almost four years, no effort was made to allay these misgivings.", "The bureaucracy lay low during Imran Khan\u2019s tenure.", "Imran Khan often said that the fear of losing makes you lose before the contest; ironically, he himself became the perfect proof of the theory. The fear of losing prominence kept Imran Khan from appointing a strong chief minister in Punjab and that fear resulted in the ", ", a chief minister who failed to inspire the bureaucracy or the public. ", "The bureaucracy having worked with Shehbaz Sharif, who had set very high standards of governance, felt a certain disillusionment. Imran Khan\u2019s maxim seemed to have been \u2018I, alone, will fix it\u2019 rather than \u2018we, together, will fix it\u2019. And that sealed his fate.", "Like, for example, Imran Khan failed to hold the high-powered board meeting to consider the promotion of officers from Grade 21 to 22, which had been due for almost two years by the time he left office. It sums up how preoccupied he was with opposing the opposition rather than focusing on governance.", "Furthermore, it has been learnt that the prime minister was conducting informal interviews of candidates for promotion from BS-21 to BS-22, ahead of the high-powered board meeting in order to assess for himself before the official meeting. Such actions potentially overlook many able officers based on personal and political biases, which can further alienate them from their job.", " ", "In fact, there was a lot of uneasiness about this snap evaluation among senior bureaucrats. The proper way would have been to reform the system and trust it to pick the correct individual, evaluated over a period of three decades rather than 30 minutes of an interview. Individual judgement can never beat a systemic assessment, but no serious efforts were made in that direction. Trying to resolve every problem based on individual judgement can work on a cricket field but rarely does so in the running of a government.", "Similarly, the civil service reforms prepared by a task force on civil service reforms headed by Dr Ishrat Husain and approved by the cabinet also did not see the light of the day and the document must now be gathering dust on some shelf at the Prime Minister\u2019s Secretariat.", "Lastly, Imran Khan came across as a prime minister in a hurry. A bit like a tsunami, which disrupted a lot of things, the initial waves he generated were very strong, but with time, they subsided, leaving almost all projects that were started unfinished. Or since we are fond of drawing cricketing parallels in politics, it was like a team chasing a huge total that started out strong, but lost wickets in the middle overs, followed by total collapse towards the end, thus falling well short of the target.", "The question remains, can he reflect on his performance and make a comeback?

The statement by the DG ISPR Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar has undercut the very foundation of the ", " that former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been peddling since the last few weeks to explain his ouster from power. ", "So what happens now?", "The diplomatic cable issue has been officially demystified. It was a routine cable written by the then ambassador to the US Asad Majeed detailing a meeting with an American official. There was nothing extraordinary about it except perhaps for the tough language used by the official. The normal response for Pakistan was to issue a d\u00e9marche, which it did. Yet someone convinced Imran Khan the cable could be used (and abused) to stitch together a Bhutto-esque nationalist narrative to explain the government\u2019s imminent ouster. It was as bad an advice as Khan could get. What was worse was the fact that he accepted it.", "Who gave Khan this advice? We do not know this for certain, yet. What we do know is: (a) The only person in the PTI cabinet who had access to the cable was the foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi (b) Whoever among Khan\u2019s closest advisers peddled this dangerous and false narrative had to have done this after reading the cable. He or she could not have read the cable \u2014 would not have had access to it \u2014 unless the foreign minister permitted this access (c) The FM, in turn, would have had to be convinced of the conspiracy aspect in order to agree for the cable to be used for a political narrative. But could he, really? Qureshi is far too experienced in these matters to not figure out there was nothing extraordinary about the cable (d) Yet, Qureshi not only went along with this cooked-up theory, he peddled it vociferously while all the time knowing (how could he not?) that not only was he fanning a concoction, but was doing so at the risk of great damage to Pakistan\u2019s diplomacy and national interest (e) Why would he do such a thing? Why did he not counter this outrageous advice to Khan? Why did he not stop Khan from pursuing this untruth?", "Imran Khan and his party are now stumped. The entire edifice of the conspiracy narrative \u2014 which led them to commit the grave sin of even violating the Constitution \u2014 has been demolished by the presentation of facts by the military spokesman. This has consequences: (a) The military was forced to come clean because of the dangerous level to which Khan and his party were inflaming the political environment through this concoction, and encouraging (if not actively promoting) a campaign on social media against the military leadership (b) Khan may now have to-rethink the conspiracy concoction and go back to the drawing board to conjure up something afresh that does not force to him to go head-on with the military. This would mean swallowing his pride (c) Or he could just double down on the conspiracy concoction regardless of the consequences (d) This would mean he will have to now basically say that the military is wrong, and he is right. He has no middle options. This would amount to taking a huge gamble because the government can very easily now prove \u2014 through a judicial commission or otherwise \u2014 the cable contains no conspiracy (e) Khan\u2019s gamble would also entail choosing a collision course with the military because he will now have to proclaim that the military is not telling the truth.", "Has Khan painted himself into a corner? He may not have any other option but to keep barrelling ahead with this dangerous and faulty narrative regardless of the facts. He has made his entire politics hostage to this one concoction and left himself very little space to pivot onto some other strategy. (a) This would bring into question something very crucial: what do you do with a populist leader who refuses to accept facts as presented by the state itself, and who prefers to build his politics on an illusion that is deeply damaging to the country and its vital interests? (b) In response, the state will then be forced to counter the PTI conspiracy concoction narrative with all the resources at its disposal in order to bury the falsehood under the weight of overwhelming facts (c) This would be disadvantageous to PTI\u2019s politics as it would mean the party \u2014 in order to defend itself \u2014 will be forced to push the falsehood even more aggressively, thereby digging itself further into a hole. At some point, the diminishing returns from such a strategy will start to extract a cost. If you have the entire weight of the government, and state, and facts, arrayed against you and the only weapon you have is a false, concocted and discredited theory, you better be ready for the cost.", "The new government could not have asked for a better gift from the PTI. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has many options: (a) Order an inquiry or constitute a commission and take all steps necessary to unveil the truth about the cable and further discredit the conspiracy concoction (b) Order various irregularities done in the PTI government to be brought into the public domain (the ", " is already out) and bring charges wherever needed. This would severely damage the PTI\u2019s \u2018honesty and anti-corruption\u2019 narrative and force the party on the defensive (c) Re-align the relationship with the establishment while Khan continues to damage his ties with them.", "Illusions and delusions, if not punctured in time, lead to great debacles.

The FBR now needs to collect Rs575 billion per month to hit the benchmark.", "The sources said that the trend of the first half of the month suggested that achieving this month\u2019s target of Rs485 billion was also difficult. The Inland Revenue Service, which is required to collect Rs5.2 trillion out of the revised annual target, had attempted to pass its partial burden to the Customs. But the Customs authorities refused to accept the proposed Rs970 billion target while sticking to its Rs917 billion target, said the sources.", "The FBR\u2019s tax collection is largely driven by imports that contributed 52% in total collection. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, the sales tax collection at the domestic stage decreased by 8.9% despite double-digit inflation in the country, which speaks about inefficiency of the tax machinery. ", "Former finance minister Shaukat Tarin had announced In June last year that he would plug in 500,000 point of sales (POS) machines and fetch additional Rs50 billion in the current fiscal year. The FBR had secured punitive powers to seal those business premises that would not integrate with the tax system. ", "However, the data showed that the FBR could integrate hardly 4,500 more businesses that installed about 10,000 more machines, suggesting the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\u2019s government\u2019s biggest initiative failed due to poor performance of the FBR. The collection from these retailers amounted to Rs16 billion -up by only Rs2.5 billion in nine months. This shows that the FBR will, in no way, be near the additional collection goal of Rs50 billion.", "Updated Apr 15, 2022", "Updated Apr 15, 2022"], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/thumbs/tribune-logo-grey-450x300.webp", "time": "2022-04-17 00:51:53", "date": "April 17, 2022", "category": "business", "source": "Tribune"},
