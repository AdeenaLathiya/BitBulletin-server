The authorities\u2019 policy agenda remains central to Pakistan\u2019s ability to refinance its external debt over the medium term, as well as our assessment of the rating, affirmed at \u2018B\u2019/Stable in February 2022.", "Fitch believed Pakistan had the ability to manage its external liquidity position in the near term if policy uncertainty was resolved relatively quickly and commodity prices do not rise substantially above forecasts for 2022-23. It expected Pakistan\u2019s access to bilateral financing to remain robust, particularly from China. The two countries\u2019 strong bilateral relationship is unlikely to be significantly weakened by Pakistan\u2019s change in leadership.", "The change in government will test how institutionalised recent reforms, such as the independence of the SBP and the more market-determined exchange rate, are, the Fitch said adding it would view slippage on reform momentum as credit negative. In the longer term, if the authorities are unable to pursue fiscal consolidation, Pakistan\u2019s access to market financing would remain constrained.", "Fitch said the outgoing government lost public support and the backing of coalition allies against a backdrop of rising inflation. Pakistan\u2019s then Prime Minister, Imran Khan, initially sought to prevent a no-confidence motion against his government. However, his ultimate acceptance of the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict that it should go ahead and the outcome of the vote strengthens the legitimacy of constitutional mechanisms.", "The recent oil price shock will push up the current-account deficit, adding to already high gross external financing needs from an elevated debt-repayment schedule. \u201cWe now forecast a current-account deficit of around 5pc of GDP (around $18.5bn) for the fiscal year ending June 2022 (FY22), up from 4pc in February review. We expect this to moderate to around 4pc in FY23, as oil prices ease\u201d.", "Pakistan faces $20bn in external debt repayments in FY23, though this includes $7bn in Chinese and Saudi deposits expected to be rolled over. Higher trade deficits and capital outflows have driven a sharp depreciation of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar.

The surge in prices reported by the Labour Department on Tuesday culminated in annual inflation rising at its fastest pace since the end of 1981. But there were some glimmers of hope, with monthly underlying price pressures rising moderately as motor vehicle prices cooled. Economists also believe overall inflation has peaked. \u201cThe Fed will take a tiny bit of comfort from today\u2019s (Tuesday\u2019s) report, but it still has much work to do to restore price stability,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The issue is delicate as expensive energy, in part because of Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, has stoked inflation and as US President Joe Biden faces pressure to lower record US gasoline prices ahead of mid-term elections in November.
