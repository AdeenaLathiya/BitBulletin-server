            "BENGALURU: Twitter Inc on Friday adopted a limited-duration shareholder rights plan to protect itself from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s $43 billion cash takeover offer.",
            "Musk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter \u2014 the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders \u2014 and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday.",
            "After his TED talk on Thursday, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter\u2019s board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: \u201cIt would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.\u201d Under the plan, also known as a \u2018poison pill\u2019 strategy to resist a bid from a potential acquirer, the rights will become exercisable if anyone acquires ownership of 15 per cent or more of Twitter\u2019s outstanding common stock in a transaction not approved by the Board.",
            "The rights plan will expire on April 14, 2023, Twitter said.",
            "According to analysts and shareholder activists, Musk could alter the course of the social media company as the management battles a set of proxy proposals focused on topics from civil rights to politics at its upcoming annual meeting.",
            "Whatever the outcome of Musk\u2019s bid to buy Twitter outright announced on Thursday, investors with opposing political views described the billionaire entrepreneur as likely to work to undo some of the restrictions on content that Twitter has imposed as it attempts to promote free speech while combating hate speech and false information.",
            "Even if he fails to buy Twitter, the Tesla CEO, who recently disclosed a 9.6 per cent stake, is seen as likely to vote in ways that could shake up the company at its virtual May 25 meeting, said people who follow corporate governance issues.",
            "\u201cGiven where Musk has positioned himself relative to the strategy of Twitter and given he wants to be something of a disrupter, I don\u2019t see him voting with management very often,\u201d said Brian Bueno of Farient Advisors, a corporate governance and executive pay consulting firm.",
            "Musk said his offer price of $54.20 per share was meant to promote open discourse. At the virtual meeting, he will control the second-largest stake after Vanguard Group, enough to give either investor a kingmaker role in close contests.",
            "Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment on how he might vote at Twitter.",
            "Musk\u2019s star power will likely draw much attention to event, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cHe\u2019s a well-known individual in the middle of all this, so it will increase the interest in voting and could have a big impact,\u201d Elson said.",
            "Although Twitter on Friday adopted a shareholder rights plan to defend itself against Musk, Elson said its impact on the voting might only be to make proxy advisers, which tend to frown on such so-called \u201cpoison pills,\u201d more skeptical of management.",
            "Twitter faces five shareholder proposals, all opposed by management, dealing with topics drawing much investor attention.",
            "Two are from conservative groups, one asking Twitter to report on its impact on civil rights and the other on its lobbying activities. Scott Shepard, a fellow at the right-leaning National Center for Public Policy Research think tank, one of the sponsors, called Musk\u2019s offer \u201cterrific\u201d for shareholders.",

            "There is no denying the database\u2019s utility. Multi-layered digitisation of big data can offer guarantees for greater transparency. Indeed, in the best-case scenario, sophisticated mobilisation of big data can refine the state\u2019s service delivery mechanisms.",
            "The Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), for instance, is one biometric transition success story in Pakistan. ",
            "The BISP\u2019s increasing automation reflects how biometric verification of credentials acknowledges the non-static, dynamic nature of data. The programme facilitates nearly 5.3 million women in accessing welfare support through real-time thumbprint recognition.",

            "These concerns are not unfounded considering the exceedingly vigilant security regime under which rights defenders, citizen activists, and journalists operate in Pakistan\u2019s data territory. ",
            "Given the size of biometrically-contained human records in the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) repository and the extent to which data-sharing occurs across, between, and beyond government agencies and LEAs, the scale of this vulnerability is likely to be huge.",

",
            "It can be rationally imagined that only when surveillance on communications is regulated exhaustively and when limitations on the jurisdiction of this surveillance are very thoroughly defined \u2013 which is possible when there are efficient legal protections accessible to all citizens indiscriminately \u2013 the privacy of citizens and the democratic guarantees that their personal data are not exploited, will not be threatened.",

            "In Pakistan, the space for an autonomous Privacy Commission gains prominence to respond to the critical need for the examination of an exceptionally large surveillance data. ",

            "Simultaneously, it is crucially significant that the data-handling and investigative capacities of FIA\u2019s National Response Centre for Cyber Crimes, are rapidly evaluated and optimised. This will ensure that PECA is enforced keeping in view the local dynamics where the government has still not rolled out enough campaigns for the purpose of educating the cyberspace occupiers in the country about the legal implications of this law on their cyber rights and responsibilities. ",

            "\t\t\t\n",
            "Mr Bilal was just an ordinary guy who like many other A-Levels students was not sure about his future. He figured out very early that he did not want to go to a university. He then planned to get an ACCA degree and decided to become an auditor. But this did not work out.",
            "Thinking that a career as a rock guitarist might be the thing for him because he had participated in several school gigs before, he decided to try his luck in singing. But Mr Bilal was counselled by his father who being a good mentor told him he would not be able to have a stable career in singing, rather he should utilise his other talent, in computers.",
            "He first used a computer when he was only 5 years old. This was where his passion for the world of computing began.",
            "Then, a friend from England told him to take a certification in Cisco and work in networking technology. He went on to complete two CCIE certifications.",
            "Still 21 years of age, he was used to getting many job offers. He even turned down the offer of a big telecommunication company in Saudi Arabia and rather chose to do a job in Beaconhouse. But thankfully within six months of his work there, he realised that his talent was being wasted and his job role was not utilising his Cisco expertise at all.",
            "A company from Abu Dhabi called him to give training sessions in Cisco. This company also specialised in disaster recovery solutions. After gaining some experience, Mr Bilal left the company to form his own company \u2013 Ikhtira Systems \u2013 in Multan, a city chosen specifically because there was no competition in disaster recovery services there. Lahore already had so many companies doing similar work. His company\u2019s name \u2018Ikhtira\u2019 was taken from a band he was a part of in high school. But just like the band, the company suffered heavy losses and failed within 10 months of operations.",
            "Mr Bilal was distraught; he did not want to go back home and ask his parents for support. People used to look up to him and appreciate the fact that he started a company at 22, and now they were making fun of him. He did not even have money to buy lunch for three consecutive days.",
            "Destiny then led him to a guy who told him to start freelancing on the Internet. He had a network of very supportive friends in Multan. Even though, he did not have money to buy his own Internet service, being the geeky genius he was, he started hacking into other people\u2019s Wi-Fi. Freelancing started making him some money. He got his first project in 10 days and although he only made $35 for his first project, he was relieved that at least now, he was earning something. \u201cThings then started moving in a good direction. Freelancing really helped,\u201d he recalls.",
            "With the confidence of some money in his pocket, he went back home and started living with his family in Vehari. But his parents were upset with his routine. He used to sleep all day and work all night. His parents worried that no girl would marry him if he continued like this. Mr Bilal then got the opportunity to move to Lahore. He started helping Arfa Karim\u2019s parents in setting up their institution in Plan9. He didn\u2019t charge them any money, just utilised the space for his own work. By this time, he had started working on Wifigen already.",
            "During his freelancing gigs, Mr Bilal got a project from someone who turned out to be John Russell Patrick, the ex-VP of IBM. He pitched Wifigen\u2019s idea to him, but although John liked the idea, he said that he did not invest in early-stage companies. Mr Bilal was nonetheless adamant that Mr John could at least mentor him. Thus, began the journey of a mentor turning into an investor.",
            "Mr Bilal then went on to do a project for another lady who had her own consultancy company in New Zealand. She introduced him to someone who wanted to be a reseller for this product in New Zealand, but was told to complete the product in two months. Mr Bilal argued that he needed funds to complete it in such a short period. The reseller in New Zealand agreed to fund the project without taking any equity. A lucky break, you may call it. He then hired some people on freelancer.com to help him build his product within 45 days. The proposed timeline for project completion was 60 days. This left a 15 days leverage to further test the product and eradicate any flaws.",
            "But that was not enough for him. He was surprised to find that anyone could apply at Plan9. It was a very open community that really motivated him. He went on to launch his own company in New Zealand. Within three months of incubation, he raised funding from his old mentor, Mr John.",
            "Then during a business trip to Singapore, he met a representative from Changi Airport who was really interested in deploying Wifigen on their airport. Mr Bilal then started beta testing Wifigen on Singapore\u2019s airport. Later on, he got Unilever Pakistan on board too. But this was only the beginning. He signed on the biggest deal in the history of Wi-Fi at Tahiti Island, which wanted to use Wifigen to give a better experience to tourists. Wifigen then was seen as a product with a huge application in the tourism industry.",
            "Mr Bilal has been trying to integrate artificial intelligence with Wi-Fi for the last three months. He realises that machine learning is necessary to make things easy for the advertisers and the people who will be using its Wi-Fi. It will allow the advertisers to know exactly who the end user is and how deep his pockets are, so they can accordingly pitch them different products.",
            "He wishes to move into more markets as business expansion will be the key driver of Wifigen\u2019s success. His company currently has a multi-million dollar valuation while trying to raise another round of investment. For all those aspiring entrepreneurs out there, he has only one thing to say: \u201cKeep failing until you are ready to change the world.\u201d",

            "Apple on Wednesday unveiled updated versions of its priciest iPhones along with a new smartwatch that allows users to take their own electrocardiograms, as the US tech giant looks to boost its momentum in a sputtering market. ",
            "The California tech giant revealed its iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, updating the top-of-the line handsets released a year earlier. The new devices are aimed at maintaining Apple's share in the premium segment. ",
            "\u201cWe are going to take iPhone X to the next level,\u201d chief executive Tim Cook said at a media event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California. ",
            "The new phones have displays of 5.8 and 6.5 inches, boosting screen size while keeping a small-format handset, Apple vice president Phil Schiller said. ",
            "The September event allows the company to unveil its latest offerings before the key holiday shopping season. ",
            "While the iPhone has made Apple the world's most valuable company, worth more than $1 trillion, it has slipped to third place among smartphone makers as Chinese-based Huawei has grabbed the number two spot. ",
            "Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said Apple had done enough \u201cto keep its smartphone growth going until the competition responds.\u201d ",

            "The watch, sold in the United States from $399 and up, will be available in stores on September 21. ",
            "\u201cApple Watch has become an intelligent guardian for your health,\u201d chief operating officer Jeff Williams said. ",

            "\u201cIdentifying a fall may sound like a straightforward problem, but it requires a lot of data analysis,\u201d Williams said. ",
            "If a person falls, and then is motionless, the watch will call emergency services, he added. ",
            "Research firm CB Insights said Apple is at a \u201ccrossroads\u201d a decade after introducing the iPhone. \n\u201cLooking for the next wave, Apple is clearly expanding into augmented reality and wearables with the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones,\u201d the firm said.",

        "content": [
            "WASHINGTON: Astron\u00adomers have discovered what may be the earliest and most distant galaxy ever observed, one that formed relatively soon after the Big Bang event that marked the origin of the universe and may be populated by the novel first generation of stars.",
            "The galaxy, called HD1, dates from a bit more than 300 million years after the Big Bang that occurred about 13.8 billion years ago, researchers said on Thursday. ",
            "The observations suggest HD1 formed stars at a staggering rate \u2014 perhaps about 100 new stars annually \u2014 or instead harbored what would be the earliest-known supermassive black hole, they added.",
            "Because of how long light takes to travel immense distances \u2014 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km) in a year \u2014 observing objects such as HD1 amounts to peering back in time. If the data is confirmed by future observations, HD1 would supplant one called GN-z11 as the earliest-known galaxy by about 100 million years. HD1 would be considered the earliest and furthest known astronomical entity.",
            "The researchers used data from telescopes in Hawaii and Chile and the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. ",
            "They hope to obtain more clarity using the James Webb Space Telescope, due to become operational within months after being launched by Nasa in December.",
            "\u201cObservational information on HD1 is limited and other physical properties remain a mystery including its shape, total mass and metallicity,\u201d said University of Tokyo astrophysicist Yuichi Harikane, lead author of research detailing the discovery published in the Astrophysical Journal.",
            "Metallicity refers to the proportion of material other than the gases hydrogen and helium that were present in the primordial universe.",
            "\u201cThe difficulty is that this is almost the limit of the capabilities of current telescopes in terms of both sensitivity and wavelength,\u201d Harikane added.",
            "Galaxies are vast assemblages of stars and interstellar matter bound by gravitational attraction, like the Milky Way in which our solar system resides. The first galaxies, arising 100 million to 150 million years after the Big Bang, were less massive and denser than those existing today, with many fewer stars.",
            "The researchers said HD1, with a mass perhaps 10 billion times greater than our sun, may have been populated with the very first generation of stars. These so-called Population III stars are hypothesized as extremely massive, luminous, hot and short-lived, composed almost exclusively of hydrogen and helium.",
            "\u201cAfter the Big Bang, some regions in space ended up being denser than others, and this attracted progressively more matter. This effect created large concentrations of gas, some of which collapsed to form stars,\u201d said astrophysicist Fabio Pacucci of the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, lead author of a related study in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters.",
            "Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were absent in the universe\u2019s initial stages, forged later inside the earliest stars and then spewed into interstellar space when they exploded at the ends of their life cycles.",
            "HD1 was observed to possess extreme ultraviolet luminosity. Population III stars could emit more UV light than ordinary stars, with HD1 possibly  \u201cundergoing a very abrupt starburst,\u201d Pacucci said.",
            "An alternative explanation for the UV luminosity could be a supermassive black hole about 100 million times more massive than our sun situated inside HD1, Pacucci added. Many galaxies including the Milky Way hold supermassive black holes at their centers. Until now, the earliest-known one of these was dated to about 700 million years after the Big Bang. The earliest stars and galaxies paved the way for those existing today.",
            "\u201cThe first galaxies ... were a millionth of the mass of the Milky Way and much denser. One way to think of them is as the building blocks in the construction project of present-day galaxies, like our own Milky Way,\u201d ",

The index will rise and investments will grow despite the wild swings last week that saw the benchmark nosedive to 43,902 points on Monday only to rise in subsequent sessions to 44,445 points.",
            "\u201cInvestors must take advantage when valuations are down. Anyone who doesn\u2019t invest now will miss the opportunity of a lifetime,\u201d said Shahid Ali Habib, CEO of Arif Habib Ltd, while speaking to Dawn. \u201cI think the index will soon cross 48,000 points,\u201d he said while forecasting an increase of between 10pc and 15pc in share prices by the end of 2021-22.",
            "The KSE-100 index has posted a negative return of 0.66pc in the last 12 months. It has lost 0.34pc since the beginning of this calendar year.",

            "The key to improvement in market conditions is foreign participation, Mr Habib said, noting that the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) needs \u201cmore and more\u201d international investors with a long-term view, which will give confidence to local investors as well. \u201cOur market is cheap in terms of the price-to-earnings (PE) multiple,\u201d he said while referring to a widely used ratio that measures a company\u2019s current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS).",
            "A higher PE multiple signifies a share is expensive while a lower multiple means the opposite. The market is trading at a trailing PE multiple of 4.6, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve historically had an average multiple of eight.\u201d",

For example, it cited the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020 (PE of 7.2), Indo-Pak border tensions in early 2019 (PE of 8.1) and the last interest rate hike and rupee depreciation towards the end of 2018 (PE of 8.8). \u201cWe do not foresee any major downside to the index,\u201d the research note said.",

            "\u201cThe country needs clarity on two fronts: economic and political. It looks like we\u2019ve got political clarity to a large extent. Now our biggest worry is the rapid decline in reserves,\u201d he said.",
            "The country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have dropped 23pc in the last couple of months to $17.5 billion. ",
            "Mr Sohail said the stock market is looking forward to the new government taking steps to arrest the rapid fall in foreign exchange reserves. It\u2019ll be better for the PSX if the new government moves swiftly to convince the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of funds under the ongoing loan programme, he said.",
            "In addition, the new government should negotiate with friendly countries like China, Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates for economic relief packages and rollover of maturing debt, he added.",
            "With respect to the deteriorating outlook on inflation and the consequent hike of as much as 250 basis points in the key interest rate, Mr Sohail said a select few sectors of the PSX stand to benefit from the rare move by the central bank.",
            "\u201cIn addition to commercial banks whose share prices are likely to appreciate following the interest rate hike, I think companies in textile, technology and exploration and production sectors will also see a positive trend. They\u2019ll be better off because they either earn in dollars or have lots of excess cash sitting on their balance sheets,\u201d he said.",
            "Mr Sohail also advised the PSX management to simplify the documentation process for account opening and due diligence \u2014 something that\u2019s become exceedingly tedious in the past couple of years and is inadvertently pushing potential investors away from the stock market.",

            "At the PTI protest, both speakers and members of the crowd condemned the alleged US role in Imran's removal, with many saying they believed the letter and conspiracy the PTI chairman spoke of was a reality. Several of Imran\u2019s supporters were also critical of the military establishment, and blamed it for his exit.",
            "Although the plan for the PTI crowd was to march to the US embassy at 2pm, hundreds of people instead turned towards Park Lane and decided to take their protest to Avenfield House. Police raced ahead of the PTI demonstrators to create a divide between PML-N workers who were already outside Nawaz\u2019s residence.",

            " that former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been peddling since the last few weeks to explain his ouster from power. ",
            "So what happens now?",
            "The diplomatic cable issue has been officially demystified. It was a routine cable written by the then ambassador to the US Asad Majeed detailing a meeting with an American official. There was nothing extraordinary about it except perhaps for the tough language used by the official. The normal response for Pakistan was to issue a d\u00e9marche, which it did. Yet someone convinced Imran Khan the cable could be used (and abused) to stitch together a Bhutto-esque nationalist narrative to explain the government\u2019s imminent ouster. It was as bad an advice as Khan could get. What was worse was the fact that he accepted it.",
            "Who gave Khan this advice? We do not know this for certain, yet. What we do know is: (a) The only person in the PTI cabinet who had access to the cable was the foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi (b) Whoever among Khan\u2019s closest advisers peddled this dangerous and false narrative had to have done this after reading the cable. He or she could not have read the cable \u2014 would not have had access to it \u2014 unless the foreign minister permitted this access (c) The FM, in turn, would have had to be convinced of the conspiracy aspect in order to agree for the cable to be used for a political narrative. But could he, really? Qureshi is far too experienced in these matters to not figure out there was nothing extraordinary about the cable (d) Yet, Qureshi not only went along with this cooked-up theory, he peddled it vociferously while all the time knowing (how could he not?) that not only was he fanning a concoction, but was doing so at the risk of great damage to Pakistan\u2019s diplomacy and national interest (e) Why would he do such a thing? Why did he not counter this outrageous advice to Khan? Why did he not stop Khan from pursuing this untruth?",
            "Imran Khan and his party are now stumped. The entire edifice of the conspiracy narrative \u2014 which led them to commit the grave sin of even violating the Constitution \u2014 has been demolished by the presentation of facts by the military spokesman. This has consequences: (a) The military was forced to come clean because of the dangerous level to which Khan and his party were inflaming the political environment through this concoction, and encouraging (if not actively promoting) a campaign on social media against the military leadership (b) Khan may now have to-rethink the conspiracy concoction and go back to the drawing board to conjure up something afresh that does not force to him to go head-on with the military. This would mean swallowing his pride (c) Or he could just double down on the conspiracy concoction regardless of the consequences (d) This would mean he will have to now basically say that the military is wrong, and he is right. He has no middle options. This would amount to taking a huge gamble because the government can very easily now prove \u2014 through a judicial commission or otherwise \u2014 the cable contains no conspiracy (e) Khan\u2019s gamble would also entail choosing a collision course with the military because he will now have to proclaim that the military is not telling the truth.",
            "Has Khan painted himself into a corner? He may not have any other option but to keep barrelling ahead with this dangerous and faulty narrative regardless of the facts. He has made his entire politics hostage to this one concoction and left himself very little space to pivot onto some other strategy. (a) This would bring into question something very crucial: what do you do with a populist leader who refuses to accept facts as presented by the state itself, and who prefers to build his politics on an illusion that is deeply damaging to the country and its vital interests? (b) In response, the state will then be forced to counter the PTI conspiracy concoction narrative with all the resources at its disposal in order to bury the falsehood under the weight of overwhelming facts (c) This would be disadvantageous to PTI\u2019s politics as it would mean the party \u2014 in order to defend itself \u2014 will be forced to push the falsehood even more aggressively, thereby digging itself further into a hole. At some point, the diminishing returns from such a strategy will start to extract a cost. If you have the entire weight of the government, and state, and facts, arrayed against you and the only weapon you have is a false, concocted and discredited theory, you better be ready for the cost.",
            "The new government could not have asked for a better gift from the PTI. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has many options: (a) Order an inquiry or constitute a commission and take all steps necessary to unveil the truth about the cable and further discredit the conspiracy concoction (b) Order various irregularities done in the PTI government to be brought into the public domain (the ",
            " is already out) and bring charges wherever needed. This would severely damage the PTI\u2019s \u2018honesty and anti-corruption\u2019 narrative and force the party on the defensive (c) Re-align the relationship with the establishment while Khan continues to damage his ties with them.",

            "WHEN a political leader makes a doubtful claim about a foreign conspiracy to oust him one is hardly surprised. Most politicians have a tenuous relationship with the truth. But what is astonishing is that an overwhelming majority of people in Pakistan have long believed such claims, focusing largely on the US.",
            " ",
            "Here is how the argument goes. Historically, the US has preferred a certain kind of government in Pakistan, such as a military regime, to serve its security and strategic interests. As the lifespan of such governments has begun and ended with the US connection, Washington must have brought them to power and removed them when they were no longer needed, it is argued.",
            "The reality is that political dynamics in Pakistan have nearly always functioned fairly autonomously, and the primary, though not always the sole, stimulus for the rise and fall of governments has been domestic, and not external. Ziaul Haq\u2019s regime was already there before the Afghan jihad and the revival of US-Pakistan relations; in fact, it had a pariah status because of the 1977 coup, the execution of an elected prime minister, and Pakistan\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was during Zia\u2019s time that Pakistan was sanctioned in 1979. But with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Zia became a celebrated leader in the West. Although Washington\u2019s support for him had begun to waver before he died, his \u2018regime\u2019 lived on.",
            "Earlier, president Ayub Khan had challenged American interests in South Asia by opening up to China. With the 1965 war adventure, he fell out of favour with US president Johnson. But he continued to rule for another four years. Yahya Khan was disregarded until he helped set up the US-China rendezvous. Gen Musharraf had been isolated for a good two years until 9/11. The US re-engagement continued well beyond him.",
            "US-Pakistan ties are not just led by America\u2019s needs.",
            "It seems that the US has abandoned the coup business. No doubt, it still acts to gain and maintain influence in other countries where its vital interests are at stake but it is contestable if it is still in the business of secretly making or breaking governments. Instead, it has gone to war, used the weapon of sanctions and supported mass movements for change like the so-called colour revolutions, all in full view.",
            "Where its interests are not critical but still important, as in Pakistan, the US also tries to influence and sometimes manipulate policies. But it does so by established diplomatic messaging, often in coercive language that comes naturally to Washington. It also exploits the vulnerability of a regime without having to change it or holding out written threats of change.",
            "The elitist, army-led and feudal-dominated \u2018organising\u2019 idea of Pakistan has for long had the US as its external pillar. To its credit, from 1954 to 1965, the US strengthened Pakistan\u2019s defence capabilities and potential for economic development, and helped launch the platform for progress. But that was the last time the US really helped Pakistan. After that neither Pakistan nor US-Pakistan relations have been the same.",
            "Pakistan\u2019s poor policy choices and endemic crisis of governance since have made it overly dependent on external financiers like the US and Saudi Arabia who have used it for their own strategic purposes. The US may no longer be the external pillar of the system but it does remain a crutch, a potential strategic and financial threat, and the largest trading partner.",
            "It is a relationship that is necessary for the country but vital for military regimes, a mixed bargain for civilian dispensations but much more for military rulers. No wonder successive governments in Pakistan have craved closer ties with the US, reflecting the leadership\u2019s dependency syndrome more than Washington\u2019s control of Pakistan.",
            " ",
            "The US-Pakistan relationship is not just led by America\u2019s needs. It is driven in equal measure by Pakistan\u2019s needs. The current US need for Pakistan is not dire enough for Washington to call for any drastic action of regime change. It is, in fact, the establishment\u2019s interests that dominate in Pakistan. It continues to have a soft corner for Washington and is perceived as managing the internal dynamics to attain its desired ends that meet the interests of both countries. The US does not need to overthrow any government.",
            "The Pakistani elite may have failed the people of Pakistan but not themselves. Over the decades, they have fought battles for power skilfully while maintaining the system that sustains them in power. The \u2018organising\u2019 idea of Pakistan over which they have presided is owned and operated by them, and not by foreign powers.",

            "One of the worst examples of this could be seen in the police apparatus, which was filled with political appointments and was largely at the beck and call of the respective party in power, facilitating VIP movements and hanging back in Vigos belonging to anyone remotely affiliated with government or their relatives.

            "For political parties to survive, they need an induction of fresh minds, not just at the lowest rungs but on the decision-making table. Parties can no longer be run as personal fiefdoms, subservient to the whims of a royal family. ",
            "If you've lived in Karachi at any point during the last three decades, you would know know the feeling of dread each time there was a disagreement between the PPP and the MQM \u2014 which, in case you've forgotten, enjoyed considerable sway back then. ",
            "In fact, each political party with a stake in the city had its own militant wing, whether it was the MQM's trigger-happy target killing squad or the Lyari-based Peoples Aman Committee nurtured by the PPP to do its dirty work. ",

            "A plan by Sri Lanka\u2019s state-owned national airline to lease nearly two dozen aircraft has sparked public criticism and opposition condemnation as the country struggles with its worst financial crisis in decades. Sri Lanka is struggling with low reserves that have declined more than 70% over the past two years to $1.93 billion at the end of March. The dollar crunch has caused acute shortages of fuel, food and medicines, with rolling power cuts for hours a day for more than a month. On Tuesday, Sri Lanka suspended some external debt repayments and said it would instead use meagre dollar cache to focus on essential imports. Protesters demanding President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign have been staging daily sit-ins outside his office. Tender notices for the lease of 42 aircraft were published on the airline\u2019s website on Thursday. SriLankan Airlines has been struggling with a fall in tourism because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis. ",

            "Moody\u2019s said Russia may be in default because it tried to service its dollar bonds in roubles, which would be one of the starkest consequences to date of Moscow\u2019s exclusion from the Western financial system since President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
            "If Moscow is declared in default, it would mark Russia\u2019s first major default on foreign bonds since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, though the Kremlin says the West is forcing a default by imposing crippling sanctions.",
            "Russia made a payment due on April 4 on two sovereign bonds - maturing in 2022 and 2042 - in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the securities.",
            "Russia \u201ctherefore may be considered a default under Moody\u2019s definition if not cured by 4 May, which is the end of the grace period,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a statement on Thursday.",

            "The Russian finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Izvestia newspaper earlier this month that if Russia is forced into a default, it will take legal action.",
            "Before Putin\u2019s February 24 order for what he casts as a special military operation in Ukraine, Russia was rated as investment grade. But its sovereign bonds have become a target in what the Kremlin says is an economic war waged by the United States.",
            "Russia in 1998 defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt and devalued the rouble under President Boris Yeltsin because it was effectively bankrupt after the Asian debt crisis and falling oil prices shook confidence in its short-term rouble debt.",
            "In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries under Vladimir Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt, shocking global debt markets because Russia then had one of the world\u2019s biggest foreign debt piles.",
            "This time, Russia has the money but cannot pay because the reserves - the world\u2019s fourth largest - that Putin ordered be built up for just such a crisis are frozen by the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada.",
            "Default",
            "As Russia could not and would not borrow right now, a default would be largely symbolic, marking the tumultuous finale to its post-Cold War attempt to integrate into the West\u2019s financial architecture.",
            "While Russia has only $40 billion in international bonds outstanding across 15 dollar or euro-denominated issues, its corporates have built up vastly more foreign debt.",

            "S&P earlier this month lowered Russia\u2019s foreign currency ratings to \u201cselective default\u201d on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debt holders.\u00a0 ",
            "Russia\u2019s economy is heading for the worst contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, with soaring inflation and capital flight. ",

On April 7, 2022, the rupee closed at an all-time low at Rs188.18 owing to speculation stemming from political turbulence in the country. Moreover, demand for the dollar stood higher compared to its supply in the wake of an expanding current account deficit, swelling imports and rising global commodity prices. Earlier, the announcement of $3 billion cash deposit by Saudi Arabia in the State Bank helped the rupee to appreciate, however, the recovery proved short-lived. The rupee had been on the downtrend since hitting 22-month high at Rs152.27 in May 2021. The SBP has injected $1.2 billion into the inter-bank market to defend the rupee in the ongoing fiscal year.

            "Musk made the bid on Wednesday in a letter to the board of Twitter - the micro-blogging platform that has become a global means of communication for individuals and world leaders - and it was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday. His offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before his 9.1% stake in the social media platform was made public.",
            "Musk, the world's richest person with a $273.6 billion fortune according to a Forbes tally, rejected an invitation to join Twitter's board on Saturday after disclosing his stake, a move analysts said signaled his takeover intentions as a board seat would have limited his shareholding to just under 15%.\u00a0",
            "After his TED talk, Musk hinted at the possibility of a hostile bid in which he would bypass Twitter's board and put the offer directly to its shareholders, tweeting: \"It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.\"",
            "Twitter was evaluating the offer with guidance from Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, according to a source. The company was also preparing a poison pill as a protective measure against Musk raising his stake as early as Friday, the source said.",
            "Shares of Twitter closed down 1.7% on Thursday.",
            "Investors were not convinced.",
            "Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal tweeted from his verified account about the deal. Describing himself as one of the \"largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter,\" he said Musk's offer undervalued the company and he rejected it.",
            "Musk, for his part, told Twitter it was his \"best and final offer\" and said he would reconsider his investment if the board rejects it.\u00a0",
            "\"This is not a way to sort of make money,\" Musk said during the TED Talk.",
            "\"My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive, is extremely important to the future of civilization,\" Musk added.",
            "Musk makes bid for Twitter",
            "Musk, a self-described \"free speech absolutist,\" has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a poll on Twitter asking users if they believed it adheres to the principle of free speech. More than 70% of the 2 million votes cast said \"No\".",
            "After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump over concerns around incitement of violence following last year's US\u00a0Capitol attack by his supporters, Musk tweeted: \"A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech.\"",
            "In remarks on Wednesday - before Musk's announcement - Trump said he \"probably wouldn't have any interest\" in returning to Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers.\u00a0",
            "Elon Musk talks at the Automotive World News Congress at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, January 13, 2015. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo",
            "White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on Musk's offer for Twitter, saying that market regulators operate independently from political leadership.",
            "Twitter employees, some of whom were panicked over Musk's impact on its ability to moderate content, attended an all-hands meeting on Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal reassured them that the company was not being \"held hostage\" by news of Musk's offer to buy the company, according to a source.",
            "Musk said US\u00a0investment bank Morgan Stanley was acting as financial adviser for his offer. He did not say how he would finance the transaction if it goes ahead, but told the TED talk audience he \"had sufficient assets,\" without saying more.",
            "CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Musk could finance the deal with debt and selling Tesla shares.",
            "Musk sold more than $15 billion worth of his Tesla\u00a0shares, about 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker, last year to settle a tax obligation.",
            "'SERIAL UNDERPERFORMER'",
            "Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters.",
            "Founded just two years after Facebook, Twitter is dwarfed by the social network. Meta, which owns Facebook, generated $118 billion in revenue in 2021 from 1.93 billion daily users. Twitter earned $5.08 billion in revenue last year from 217 million daily users.",
            "\"The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.",
            "Twitter's stock market value has lagged rivals",
            "Twitter will not decide on the fate of Musk's bid on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the situation. What the board is discussing is the parameters of the valuation process and it would then ask its advisers to review the bid and await for the results, the source said.",
            "Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the US\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commision requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some of his Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla private.",
            "\"If he really wants to take Twitter private his past run-ins with regulators might not pose an obstacle \u2013 but it might make potential financing sources leery of providing the cash for the deal \u2013 unless he is willing to pledge a large portion of his Tesla holdings to collateralize the debt,\" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the SEC.",
            "Musk's move also raises the question of whether other bidders might emerge for Twitter.",
            "\"It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.",
            "Musk admitted at the conference that success was not assured but his intent was to retain as many shareholders as allowed by law in a private company.",
            "Asked if there was a \"Plan B\" if Twitter rejected the offer, Musk told the TED conference audience without elaborating: \"There is.\""

            "Twitter Inc\u00a0adopted a 'poison pill' on Friday to limit Elon Musk's ability to raise his stake in the social media platform, as a buyout firm emerged to challenge his $43 billion bid for the company.",

            "Twitter said on Friday it adopted a poison pill that would dilute anyone amassing a stake in the company of more than 15% by selling more shares to other shareholders at a discount. Known formally as a shareholder rights plan, the poison pill will be in place for 364 days.",
            "The move would not bar Musk from taking his offer directly to Twitter shareholders by launching a tender offer. While the poison pill would prevent most Twitter shareholders from selling their shares, the tender offer would allow them to register their support or disapproval of Musk's offer.",
            "\"It is a predictable defensive measure for the board to go down that will not be viewed positively by shareholders given the potential dilution and acquisition unfriendly move,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tweeted on Friday.",
            "Thoma Bravo's interest raises the specter of more private equity firms vying for Twitter. The global private equity industry is sitting on about $1.8 trillion in dry powder, according to data provider Preqin. Unlike major technology conglomerates, most buyout firms would not face antitrust restrictions in acquiring Twitter.",
            "It remains possible that a private equity firm will boost Musk's bid by partnering with him rather than challenging him. Musk's criticism of Twitter's reliance on advertising for most of its revenue, however, has made some private equity firms apprehensive about teaming up with him, industry sources said. This is because a strong cash flow makes financing a leveraged buyout much easier.",

            "Silver Lake, a private equity firm with more than $90 billion in assets under management, would be a natural partner for Musk because it offered financing for his $72-billion bid for Tesla Inc\u00a0four years ago, which Musk subsequently abandoned. Silver Lake co-chief executive Egon Durban also sits on Twitter's board.",
            "But Durban did not recuse himself on Thursday when Twitter's board met to discuss Musk's offer for the first time, people familiar with the matter said, in a sign that Silver Lake has not sought to team up with Musk or make a bid of its own thus far.",

            "Twitter has more than $6 billion of cash on its balance sheet and its annual cash flow is close to $700 million, providing some comfort to banks considering whether should provide debt for a deal. Still, a leveraged buyout for Twitter could be the biggest of all time, potentially requiring several buyout firms and other major institutional investors to team up.",

He informed Twitter on Wednesday that his $54.20-per-share all-cash bid for the company was his \"best and final offer\", and that he would reconsider his position as a Twitter shareholder if it was rejected. Musk owns more than 9% of Twitter, making him the largest shareholder after mutual fund giant Vanguard.",

Twitter's board is still assessing Musk's offer and would only put it to the company's shareholders for a vote if it approves it. Twitter shares fell on Thursday, indicating that most investors expect the company's board to reject Musk's bid as inadequate and thin on financing details.\u00a0",
