                "Aamir Aziz, a manufacturer and exporter of finished textile goods, said the industry had been importing modern textile machines to compete with regional countries. He said Bangladesh and India were already working with state-of-the-art machines.",

                "AVOIDING the mistakes made earlier, the government will hopefully set its priorities right in the context of the Reko Diq project. Before sealing the deal with Barrick Gold, the world second biggest precious metals company, it seems prudent to first have on board the most credible guarantors, the people of Balochistan, through their representatives in national and provincial assemblies and their designated group of technical and legal experts.",
                "Responding to a ",
                " query in this regard, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said: \u201cThe draft of the framework agreement was shared with all the relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the deal with Barrick Gold will only be sealed after clearance from the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the national and Balochistan assemblies.\u201d",
                "Defending the decision, which some experts found hasty, he said: \u201cWe had to sign the framework because Tethyan Copper Company [a joint venture company of Barrick Gold and Antofagasta Minerals] had given us reprieve from courts till March 31.\u201d",
                "Recently, Pakistan reached an out-of-court settlement with two foreign mineral companies to write off their financial claims against the government in exchange for reconstitution of the project for the development of Reko Diq mines on the basis of an equal partnership. The government claimed it was able to dodge a hefty $11 billion penalty through this ",
                ". ",
                "The out-of-court settlement is good news for the country, but the govt\u2019s hand might have been a bit forced by the March 31 time bar",
                "The federal and Balochistan governments and two companies, Antofagasta PLC and Barrick Gold Corporation, earlier this month agreed on a framework to revive Reko Diq project and a pathway for the exit of one firm. Antofagasta consented to withdraw all claims and move away if Pakistan initiates the payment process of $900 million before the turn of the current month against the court award of $3.7bn. ",
                "An informed source in Islamabad active in mining circles told ",
                " that Pakistan has pledged to divert the signing bonus of $900m with Barrick Gold for the mining deal to Antofagasta to ease it out.",
                "This piece of information was indirectly confirmed by the finance minister while answering the query on the motivation, haste and timing of the deal in the midst of the ongoing political turmoil. ",
                "\u201cWe had reasons to do it now, and it was not to appease anyone. By March 31, we were obligated to open a conditional standby letter of credit (SBLC) in favour of Antofagasta for $900m. Funds will now be released once the legalisation process is complete,\u201d Mr Tarin said. ",
                "Further details of the deal have yet to surface, but, according to the available information, the federal and Balochistan governments will collectively hold a 50 per cent stake in the project and Barrick Gold will keep the other half. The federal government will pool in $1bn for 50pc stakes, covering also for Balochistan government for the initial $2bn investment in the project. In addition, the government of Balochistan will get 2pc royalty from the sales proceeds.",
                "On the question of the funding requirement of $1bn, the minister said the group of state-owned enterprises participating in the project would furnish the pledged amount.",
                "The National Party, a mainstream political party of the restive province, instantly opposed the deal, terming it \u201canti-people and anti-Balochistan\u201d. ",
                "A senior economist, who wished not to be named, said: \u201cyou can\u2019t blame the people of Balochistan for having suspicions. This is what happens when you sell wheat to Balochistan at the international price and buy their gas at a fraction of the price you pay to Qatar.\u201d",
                "Continuing, he said government functionaries in the relevant department in Balochistan and in Islamabad know how the TCC in the 2000s tried to buy its way through when challenged for the breach of the Reko Diq contract.",
                "A former commerce secretary conceded that the burden of turning the case upside down, with Pakistan being penalised in international arbitration court, falls on the recklessness of over-confident government functionaries.",
                "A legal expert, who followed the arbitration process from close quarters and have been critical of the government\u2019s lack of capacity to deal with commercial disputes, said the new mining deal ought to be weaker than the earlier one.  \u201cA deal negotiated in desperation can\u2019t possibly be the best,\u201d he argued. ",
                "\u201cThe devil is in the details. It would be stupid to expect global mining giants to write off big fines because of the goodness of their hearts. They must have extracted big concessions from Pakistan against guaranteed returns manifold more than what they have decided to forego. The government should make the key deal public for proper scrutiny by legal and technical experts,\u201d he stressed. ",
                "\u201cIt\u2019s an old habit of the rulers to bend backwards to accommodate overseas investors. I am keen to find out tax holidays and other concessions rolled out this time round,\u201d he remarked.",
                "\u201cThe deal might not be ideal, but, if finalised, it will open many doors for foreign investment in Pakistan. Global investors did take note of the green signal to Barrick in Pakistan. I expect a rush of mining companies if things move ahead smoothly,\u201d said a mineral mining expert though he regretted the exclusion of private Pakistani mining companies from the Reko Diq deal.",
                "\u201cHad the local mining companies given a chance to be part of the project, they could have ensured greater transparency and swift movement of the project. The state-owned enterprises [Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum and Government Holdings Pakistan] have no experience in mineral mining and may falter,\u201d he argued.",
                "The effort to develop mineral reserves in Balochistan, initiated in 1992, did not go much beyond some feasibility reports that confirmed underground riches. The cost of this lingering 30-year exercise, mired in controversies, was steep as it stained the country\u2019s image, cost it heavy in penalties and blunted the thrust towards developing the vast mineral sector for the benefit of the most impoverished people in the richest province of the country.

It keeps its trade deficit large \u2014 often equal to its total export earnings and sometimes even larger. ",
                "And, it is cyclical because the country has been trying to become more competitive in foreign trade and making a series of efforts to support the export sector.

                "The net addition of $19.759bn worth of the government\u2019s external debt in just three and a half years cannot be overlooked in analysing fiscal and external sector issues. Growing stocks of external debt mean larger external debt servicing and consequent pressure on forex reserves and the rupee\u2019s health.

But, on the other hand, the goods\u2019 trade deficit has also become too large at the same time. Back in 2017-18, the trade deficit for the entire year was $37.6bn. Against this, the deficit in just eight months of 2021-22 stood at $31.9bn, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.

In future, the C/A management will require more serious efforts to accelerate export earnings, decelerate growth in imports of finished goods particularly luxury items. ",
                "And it will also require persistent efforts to ensure double-digit growth in remittances which seems a far cry given the fact that for about the past three years demand for Pakistani workers abroad has been on the decline. In 2019, 625,876 Pakistanis had left abroad for jobs. The number tanked to 225,213 in 2020 before rising to 288,280 in 2021 \u2014 partly reflecting the effects of Covid-19 triggered travel bans across the globe.

Even this utilisation is mainly because of maximum use for foreign funds for development schemes \u2014 at Rs80bn against annual foreign exchange component of Rs100bn \u2014 otherwise, the utilisation was struggling at just Rs325bn in nine months.

He also includes the cost of electricity price cut in his calculations.",

The principal accounts officers (PAOs), namely bureaucrats, have no powers to take major policy decisions except to authorise or stop funds already approved by the parliament and placed at their disposal. But in such times, they become overcautious and tend not to displease the incoming government.",

                " that former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been peddling since the last few weeks to explain his ouster from power. ",
                "So what happens now?",
                "The diplomatic cable issue has been officially demystified. It was a routine cable written by the then ambassador to the US Asad Majeed detailing a meeting with an American official. There was nothing extraordinary about it except perhaps for the tough language used by the official. The normal response for Pakistan was to issue a d\u00e9marche, which it did. Yet someone convinced Imran Khan the cable could be used (and abused) to stitch together a Bhutto-esque nationalist narrative to explain the government\u2019s imminent ouster. It was as bad an advice as Khan could get. What was worse was the fact that he accepted it.",
                "Who gave Khan this advice? We do not know this for certain, yet. What we do know is: (a) The only person in the PTI cabinet who had access to the cable was the foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi (b) Whoever among Khan\u2019s closest advisers peddled this dangerous and false narrative had to have done this after reading the cable. He or she could not have read the cable \u2014 would not have had access to it \u2014 unless the foreign minister permitted this access (c) The FM, in turn, would have had to be convinced of the conspiracy aspect in order to agree for the cable to be used for a political narrative. But could he, really? Qureshi is far too experienced in these matters to not figure out there was nothing extraordinary about the cable (d) Yet, Qureshi not only went along with this cooked-up theory, he peddled it vociferously while all the time knowing (how could he not?) that not only was he fanning a concoction, but was doing so at the risk of great damage to Pakistan\u2019s diplomacy and national interest (e) Why would he do such a thing? Why did he not counter this outrageous advice to Khan? Why did he not stop Khan from pursuing this untruth?",
                "Imran Khan and his party are now stumped. The entire edifice of the conspiracy narrative \u2014 which led them to commit the grave sin of even violating the Constitution \u2014 has been demolished by the presentation of facts by the military spokesman. This has consequences: (a) The military was forced to come clean because of the dangerous level to which Khan and his party were inflaming the political environment through this concoction, and encouraging (if not actively promoting) a campaign on social media against the military leadership (b) Khan may now have to-rethink the conspiracy concoction and go back to the drawing board to conjure up something afresh that does not force to him to go head-on with the military. This would mean swallowing his pride (c) Or he could just double down on the conspiracy concoction regardless of the consequences (d) This would mean he will have to now basically say that the military is wrong, and he is right. He has no middle options. This would amount to taking a huge gamble because the government can very easily now prove \u2014 through a judicial commission or otherwise \u2014 the cable contains no conspiracy (e) Khan\u2019s gamble would also entail choosing a collision course with the military because he will now have to proclaim that the military is not telling the truth.",
                "Has Khan painted himself into a corner? He may not have any other option but to keep barrelling ahead with this dangerous and faulty narrative regardless of the facts. He has made his entire politics hostage to this one concoction and left himself very little space to pivot onto some other strategy. (a) This would bring into question something very crucial: what do you do with a populist leader who refuses to accept facts as presented by the state itself, and who prefers to build his politics on an illusion that is deeply damaging to the country and its vital interests? (b) In response, the state will then be forced to counter the PTI conspiracy concoction narrative with all the resources at its disposal in order to bury the falsehood under the weight of overwhelming facts (c) This would be disadvantageous to PTI\u2019s politics as it would mean the party \u2014 in order to defend itself \u2014 will be forced to push the falsehood even more aggressively, thereby digging itself further into a hole. At some point, the diminishing returns from such a strategy will start to extract a cost. If you have the entire weight of the government, and state, and facts, arrayed against you and the only weapon you have is a false, concocted and discredited theory, you better be ready for the cost.",
                "The new government could not have asked for a better gift from the PTI.

                " against Prime Minister Imran Khan is leading to serious and lingering economic uncertainty. The global geo-political situation following the Russian invasion of Ukraine is having a multiplying effect.",
                "The combination of the two is like a culling machine. Foreign exchange reserves are falling as import bills on the back of oil prices grow, bond yields are increasing, and remittances are straightening out while financing needs increase amid rupee depreciation, double-digit inflation and stock exchange on a downhill path.",
                "This all is a source of perpetual pain for millions of citizens. But the biggest challenge for any government after the political turmoil settles down would be how to absorb the costs of policy distortions that have crept into the system over the past few weeks.",

                " on electricity and oil prices with a four-month freeze to pre-relief level once prudent economic sense prevails. The resultant increase in the circular debt and fiscal deficit otherwise will have their own lagged impact in the shape of inflation and higher debt. These cannot be wished away with delays and indecision.",
                "The fundamental economic challenges are back to square one despite a lot of pain absorbed by the citizens over the last couple of years",
                "As if that is not enough, there is no clarity at all at this moment on how the domestic political and external factors behave in the near future. The possibilities in terms of survival of the current government, an interim government and the term of its tenure or the general elections and the future government have varying degrees of economic costs. The Ukraine crisis is already turning global economies upside down soon after the Covid-induced recession.",
                "The preoccupation with political crises is already having an impact on decision making and governance. The prime minister has not been able to hold a meeting of the federal cabinet for almost a month against the normal weekly schedule. Among the lost list of items on the agenda of the scheduled but cancelled cabinet meeting on March 1 included a mid-year review of the federal budget 2021-22 and key economic indicators. The normal workings at the federal secretariat have also been affected as bureaucrats adopt a \u2018wait & see approach\u2019 on day to day running of the government.",
                "That is also where the talks between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistan authorities remain inconclusive. While the initial objections revolved around populist moves, particularly the relief package, announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan last month, reversing a major impact of the mini-budget under IMF prior actions, the concerns have now shifted to the ",
                " of the ongoing IMF programme. Reneged IMF targets would come back to haunt future Pakistan governments and people in the shape of even more stringent prior actions.",
                "With the no-confidence move by the joint opposition, the scope of these concerns has rather expanded, adding fuel to the uncertainties. The more relevant anxieties now pertain to questions if an interim set-up could carry forward the remaining part of the Fund programme and whether or not it could return to the mini-budget announced in January and what if a future majority in parliament shuns ownership of the State Bank law.",
                "In such circumstances, the IMF staff may hesitate to bring up Pakistan\u2019s case before its executive board for the remaining tranches at least before the upcoming spring meetings in the third week of April. Perhaps because of such an eventuality, the government had taken a wish list of about $21 billion financial support from China during Prime Minister Khan\u2019s visit. This included about $4.3bn debt rollover maturing within the current month.",
                "Pakistan expected an arrangement with China with the consent of the IMF to have access to a part of the $40bn increased quota the Fund had allowed to China as part of its Covid-19 quota expansion to member countries. On return from Beijing, Prime Minister\u2019s Special Assistant on CPEC Affairs Khalid Mansoor had told a news conference that Chinese leadership took note of these requests and promised to consider and then communicate their decision accordingly in response to questions about Pakistan\u2019s request for the $4bn debt rollover, extension in currency swap from the existing $4.5bn to $10bn and $5.5bn in additional financial support.",
                "While authorities anxiously await a formal response, the political uncertainty may have some ramifications here too as Chinese leadership may like to steer clear of the situation. The current account deficit, in the meanwhile, has reached almost $12bn in the first seven months with full-year projections at around $18-19bn \u2014 a level the PTI had inherited in 2018.",
                "Even though the PTI government did not inherit an ideal situation, its indecision or delayed decision to go back to the IMF cost the country dearly. Amid tough stabilisation policy, the worst ever health pandemic rather came as a saving grace as international lenders, particularly the IMF, opted for an accommodative policy and provided additional financial assistance with almost no strings attached.",
                "But the authorities failed to push through long-standing structural reforms and instead came up with three money-whitening schemes. Also, it diverted more funds out of external support to big businesses rather than making them efficient and competitive. The belated increases in electricity rates aimed at containing circular debt have been brought back to a level initiated two years ago.",
                "The fundamental economic challenges are back to square one despite a lot of pain absorbed by the citizens over the last couple of years. Pakistan again stands at the crossroads it comes across every election cycle. The difference this time is that challenges are greater than before and remedies may also be even tougher as uncertainties prolong. ",

                " \u2013 a tool that gives free Wi-Fi to customers in exchange for their information. It is a software that operates on a subscription based model, costing around $20 per month only per access point, and uses permission-based Facebook API to give user access.",
                "\t\t\t\n",
                "Mr Bilal was just an ordinary guy who like many other A-Levels students was not sure about his future. He figured out very early that he did not want to go to a university. He then planned to get an ACCA degree and decided to become an auditor. But this did not work out.",
                "Thinking that a career as a rock guitarist might be the thing for him because he had participated in several school gigs before, he decided to try his luck in singing. But Mr Bilal was counselled by his father who being a good mentor told him he would not be able to have a stable career in singing, rather he should utilise his other talent, in computers.",
                "He first used a computer when he was only 5 years old. This was where his passion for the world of computing began.",
                "Then, a friend from England told him to take a certification in Cisco and work in networking technology. He went on to complete two CCIE certifications.",
                "Still 21 years of age, he was used to getting many job offers. He even turned down the offer of a big telecommunication company in Saudi Arabia and rather chose to do a job in Beaconhouse. But thankfully within six months of his work there, he realised that his talent was being wasted and his job role was not utilising his Cisco expertise at all.",
                "A company from Abu Dhabi called him to give training sessions in Cisco. This company also specialised in disaster recovery solutions. After gaining some experience, Mr Bilal left the company to form his own company \u2013 Ikhtira Systems \u2013 in Multan, a city chosen specifically because there was no competition in disaster recovery services there. Lahore already had so many companies doing similar work. His company\u2019s name \u2018Ikhtira\u2019 was taken from a band he was a part of in high school. But just like the band, the company suffered heavy losses and failed within 10 months of operations.",
                "Mr Bilal was distraught; he did not want to go back home and ask his parents for support. People used to look up to him and appreciate the fact that he started a company at 22, and now they were making fun of him. He did not even have money to buy lunch for three consecutive days.",
                "Destiny then led him to a guy who told him to start freelancing on the Internet. He had a network of very supportive friends in Multan. Even though, he did not have money to buy his own Internet service, being the geeky genius he was, he started hacking into other people\u2019s Wi-Fi. Freelancing started making him some money. He got his first project in 10 days and although he only made $35 for his first project, he was relieved that at least now, he was earning something. \u201cThings then started moving in a good direction. Freelancing really helped,\u201d he recalls.",
                "With the confidence of some money in his pocket, he went back home and started living with his family in Vehari. But his parents were upset with his routine. He used to sleep all day and work all night. His parents worried that no girl would marry him if he continued like this. Mr Bilal then got the opportunity to move to Lahore. He started helping Arfa Karim\u2019s parents in setting up their institution in Plan9. He didn\u2019t charge them any money, just utilised the space for his own work. By this time, he had started working on Wifigen already.",
                "During his freelancing gigs, Mr Bilal got a project from someone who turned out to be John Russell Patrick, the ex-VP of IBM. He pitched Wifigen\u2019s idea to him, but although John liked the idea, he said that he did not invest in early-stage companies. Mr Bilal was nonetheless adamant that Mr John could at least mentor him. Thus, began the journey of a mentor turning into an investor.",
                "Mr Bilal then went on to do a project for another lady who had her own consultancy company in New Zealand. She introduced him to someone who wanted to be a reseller for this product in New Zealand, but was told to complete the product in two months. Mr Bilal argued that he needed funds to complete it in such a short period. The reseller in New Zealand agreed to fund the project without taking any equity. A lucky break, you may call it. He then hired some people on freelancer.com to help him build his product within 45 days. The proposed timeline for project completion was 60 days. This left a 15 days leverage to further test the product and eradicate any flaws.",
                "But that was not enough for him. He was surprised to find that anyone could apply at Plan9. It was a very open community that really motivated him. He went on to launch his own company in New Zealand. Within three months of incubation, he raised funding from his old mentor, Mr John.",
                "Then during a business trip to Singapore, he met a representative from Changi Airport who was really interested in deploying Wifigen on their airport. Mr Bilal then started beta testing Wifigen on Singapore\u2019s airport. Later on, he got Unilever Pakistan on board too. But this was only the beginning. He signed on the biggest deal in the history of Wi-Fi at Tahiti Island, which wanted to use Wifigen to give a better experience to tourists. Wifigen then was seen as a product with a huge application in the tourism industry.",
                "Mr Bilal has been trying to integrate artificial intelligence with Wi-Fi for the last three months. He realises that machine learning is necessary to make things easy for the advertisers and the people who will be using its Wi-Fi. It will allow the advertisers to know exactly who the end user is and how deep his pockets are, so they can accordingly pitch them different products.",
                "He wishes to move into more markets as business expansion will be the key driver of Wifigen\u2019s success. His company currently has a multi-million dollar valuation while trying to raise another round of investment. For all those aspiring entrepreneurs out there, he has only one thing to say: \u201cKeep failing until you are ready to change the world.\u201d",

The global private equity industry is sitting on about $1.8 trillion in dry powder, according to data provider Preqin. Unlike major technology conglomerates, most buyout firms would not face antitrust restrictions in acquiring Twitter.",
            "It remains possible that a private equity firm will boost Musk's bid by partnering with him rather than challenging him. Musk's criticism of Twitter's reliance on advertising for most of its revenue, however, has made some private equity firms apprehensive about teaming up with him, industry sources said. This is because a strong cash flow makes financing a leveraged buyout much easier.",

Silver Lake co-chief executive Egon Durban also sits on Twitter's board.",
            "But Durban did not recuse himself on Thursday when Twitter's board met to discuss Musk's offer for the first time, people familiar with the matter said, in a sign that Silver Lake has not sought to team up with Musk or make a bid of its own thus far.",

            "'BEST AND FINAL OFFER'",
            "Twitter has more than $6 billion of cash on its balance sheet and its annual cash flow is close to $700 million, providing some comfort to banks considering whether should provide debt for a deal. Still, a leveraged buyout for Twitter could be the biggest of all time, potentially requiring several buyout firms and other major institutional investors to team up.",
            "Musk is the world's richest person with a net worth pegged by Forbes at $265 billion. He has however drawn a line on how much he is willing to pay. He informed Twitter on Wednesday that his $54.20-per-share all-cash bid for the company was his \"best and final offer\", and that he would reconsider his position as a Twitter shareholder if it was rejected. Musk owns more than 9% of Twitter, making him the largest shareholder after mutual fund giant Vanguard.",
            "Musk tweeted on Thursday that Twitter's shareholders should have a say on his offer and posted a poll on Twitter in which most users agreed with him. Twitter's board is still assessing Musk's offer and would only put it to the company's shareholders for a vote if it approves it. Twitter shares fell on Thursday, indicating that most investors expect the company's board to reject Musk's bid as inadequate and thin on financing details.\u00a0",
            "Twitter's board is expected to take several more days to assess Musk's bid and draft its response, the sources familiar with the matter said. An outcome over the weekend is unlikely, the sources added.",

            "The FBR also could not deliver on the previous government\u2019s single largest initiative to integrate the 500,000 retail machines with the tax system and collect additional Rs50 billion in revenue. Till March, it could integrate less than 4,500 businesses that paid additional revenue of about Rs2.5 billion, according to the sources. FBR registered less than 3,900 retailers who integrated about 8,600 machines with the FBR system during the current fiscal year.",
            "On March 31, the FBR issued a press release and claimed that it provisionally collected Rs575 billion in revenue, lifting the total collection to Rs4.382 trillion. However, The Express Tribune at that time reported that the actual taxes that were deposited in the kitty amounted to Rs561 billion and the figure could marginally improve on the back of book adjustments. ",
            "The reconciled figures showed that the tax collection in March remained Rs35 billion short of the monthly target and was still Rs6 billion less than what the FBR had claimed in its press release over two weeks ago.",
            "It was the first time that the reconciled tax collection remained less than the provisionally released figures, giving credence to the reports that the FBR deliberately fudged the figures. ",
            "The Express Tribune had sent questions to the FBR spokesman five days ago and his responses were awaited till the filing of the story. The FBR spokesman had been requested to comment whether the FBR fudged the collection figures and who directed the authority to manipulate the numbers. The international financial institutions take strong exception to figure fudging, which also erodes policy makers, stakeholders and the government\u2019s trust in the taxmen. ",
            "The FBR has not yet issued a statement to the media about the actual tax collection. It is not clear whether the FBR will present the manipulated or actual tax collection figures to the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif next week. The premier had directed the FBR to give a presentation on its performance with a focus on measures to end harassment of taxpayers.",
            "The taxpayers have been making hue and cry against undue tax demand notices that the FBR is sending to them without following the due process. As a result, the tax amount stuck up in litigation has suddenly doubled to Rs3.6 trillion.",
            "For the current fiscal year, the last government had set tax target at Rs5.829, which was increased to Rs6.1 trillion in January this year after the Rs360 billion mini-budget was introduced. The FBR now needs to collect Rs575 billion per month to hit the benchmark.",
            "The sources said that the trend of the first half of the month suggested that achieving this month\u2019s target of Rs485 billion was also difficult. The Inland Revenue Service, which is required to collect Rs5.2 trillion out of the revised annual target, had attempted to pass its partial burden to the Customs. But the Customs authorities refused to accept the proposed Rs970 billion target while sticking to its Rs917 billion target, said the sources.",
            "The FBR\u2019s tax collection is largely driven by imports that contributed 52% in total collection. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, the sales tax collection at the domestic stage decreased by 8.9% despite double-digit inflation in the country, which speaks about inefficiency of the tax machinery. ",
            "Former finance minister Shaukat Tarin had announced In June last year that he would plug in 500,000 point of sales (POS) machines and fetch additional Rs50 billion in the current fiscal year. The FBR had secured punitive powers to seal those business premises that would not integrate with the tax system. ",
            "However, the data showed that the FBR could integrate hardly 4,500 more businesses that installed about 10,000 more machines, suggesting the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\u2019s government\u2019s biggest initiative failed due to poor performance of the FBR. The collection from these retailers amounted to Rs16 billion -up by only Rs2.5 billion in nine months. This shows that the FBR will, in no way, be near the additional collection goal of Rs50 billion.",
